            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

One buzzing to the other, as one Raven inviting another, at this lambing-time of the yeare, that the young brood at the ſame minute may ſee the light and loſe their eyes.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For this one ſingle ſimple <hi>A. S.</hi> now ſtarts up by himſelfe, peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily to ſtate, and determine the Queſtions, for the reſolution whereof the Parliament thought the Aſſembly of Divines few enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake; and therefore call'd all them together for that purpoſe, who are now moſt intent upon the pin of the controverſie; yet as if <hi>A.

Goe then <hi>A. S.</hi> and carrie, if you dare, your platforme to the Parliament, and intreate the learned Aſſembly to diſſolve.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>A. S.</hi> will goe his owne way, and thereby hee hath given great offence to the <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> to charge them all of diſſenting from the five Miniſters, &amp; awakening mens ſpirits into replyes, when before they were drowſing with long expectation theſe two years of a publike determination, and I wiſh this might have been the laſt Reply, before all things were ſweetly compoſed.

                  <hi>A.

S.</hi> is bitterly angry they cloſe no more, before the point be diſputed. O, it was a fault of the Cynick Philoſopher in his high ſhooes ſo to dance on the Platonick Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Bed and Arras Coverlet, with boaſting, that <hi>he danced on his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philoſophers pride,</hi> as that the patient Philoſopher could juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, yea, ſaith he, <hi>Thou danceſt on my pride with thy greater pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How much of this is <hi>A. S.</hi> I ſay not; but ſure it was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonableſt, if not the moſt unſavoury book to multitudes of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all palates, as ever wiſe man put forth.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Iames Cranford</hi> is quoted by the Printer in the page before the Title, as approving it and the book with a licentious approbation, in theſe words; <hi>Theſe judicious Obſervations and Annotations, &amp;c. as being at this time neceſſarie and ſeaſonable for the vindication of all Proteſtant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, defending the authority of Parliaments and Synods, and prevention of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion amongst our ſelves, (though I reverence the perſons of the Apologiſts, yet) I approve to be impreſſed.</hi>

S. judicious,</hi> that are extra-judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and prejudiciall to the publick peace and order, and ordinance for diſpute, prejudging and adjudging them, who joyntly with the grave Aſſembly, <hi>A. S.</hi> acknowledgeth the Arbitrator in the matters in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion? Are they at this time <hi>neceſſarie,</hi> when the grave Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> had with farre more prudence and ſolidity then <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaid by way of reply ſo much to the Apologie, <hi>Nemine reclamante,</hi> none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying till <hi>A. S.</hi> was abroad? Is there any need to bring a great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Preſſe, to ſqueeſe to death a poore worme troden on before? Or to bring many leavers to break an egge, that makes ſmall reſiſtance? The truth is, <hi>A. S.</hi> his Obſervations are like a man with a Pole-axe, knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man on the head to kill a flie lighting on his beard.</p>
               <p>For though he ſaith, <hi>He humbly ſubmitteth to the Proteſtant Churches,</hi> yet hee layes about him as if hee would knock them all down unto a ſubmiſſion to <hi>A. S.</hi> whoſoever they be that will not ſtoop to his book. For though he thinkes that all <hi>Proteſtant and Chriſtian Churches</hi> are <hi>for</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:196793:5"/> 
                  <hi>him</hi> rather then for the <hi>five Miniſters,</hi> as he intimates in the beginning of his Epiſtle, and therefore in all likelihood profeſſeth a ſubmiſſion to them, yet he will find many Churches in <hi>London</hi> (he would wonder if we ſhould name how many) that will not ſubmit to his book, and yet come to the publick Ordinance, doe not ſeparate, but are moſt willing to ſubmit to the truth, regularly diſcuſſed, cleared, and brought down to them. Yet ſtill <hi>James Cranford</hi> ſtands fixed in the licence page, in black and not bluſh, for aſſerting that <hi>A. S.</hi> his Obſervations, &amp;c. are <hi>judicious</hi> and <hi>neceſſarie;</hi> when as they are neither, unleſſe <hi>prepoſterouſneſſe, abuſe of good men,</hi> and the <hi>diſturbance of the people,</hi> be <hi>judicious</hi> and <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi> For though the enſuing anſwer will prove them evill, yet they will never be proved neceſſarie evils. They are not ſo much as <hi>civilly neceſſary,</hi> either <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> as commanded by Parliament, or Aſſembly, or <hi>neceſſitate medii,</hi> as uſefull to compoſe, but indiſpoſe the minds of men, to embrace things prejudiced with the violence of private ſpirits. Men will not be ſo eaſily whipt and compelled by one inferiour.</p>
               <p>Again, are the Obſervations <hi>ſeaſonable,</hi> which doe but <hi>interſtrepere,</hi> make a noyſe, whilſt the Divines are diſputing, drawing the people together in heaps, there taking up their parts, to defend one againſt another, and pre-ingage themſelves before they come to heare what the Aſſembly will ſay? For ſuch a book cannot come forth, but it makes a thouſand diſpute in a week, every one then contending for his owne, when it is ſo irregularly and illegally taken from him. Are they for the <hi>vindication of all Proteſtant Churches,</hi> when as in condemning the Apology, they condemne <hi>many,</hi> very many Churches in <hi>England, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> generally <hi>all</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> notwithſtanding ſome private Letters and Manuſcripts ſent over, to which we ſhall anſwer afterwards.

               <p> If the Parliament have no directive power in matters of Religion, or Eccleſiaſticall, under any notion; then <hi>A. S.</hi> will condemn them for voting down the new Canons, and preſcribing the Oath or Covenant.</p>
               <p>Are theſe Obſervations for the <hi>defence of the autboritie of Synods,</hi> in oppoſition to the Apologie? What Synods? <hi>Scripture-Synods?</hi> Where doth the Apologie whimper againſt them? or doe you mean <hi>Claſſicall</hi> ones? If ſo, that's the queſtion.

               </p>
               <p>Well.

               <p>M. S. Now let the Proteſtant Churches (to whom you ſay you ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) judge whether in theſe words, there be not a notorious untruth. For wherein doe the five Miniſters and their Churches differ from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:196793:6"/> Churches in <hi>England,</hi> diverſe in <hi>Holland,</hi> and generally all within the Patent of <hi>New-England,</hi> if you account theſe places Proteſtant?</p>
               <p>It may be you will object, Mr. <hi>Parkers Letter and ſome Manuſcripts from New-England, and the Letter from Zeland.</hi> To Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we neede ſay little, the Letter will anſwer for us, though Mr. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> little thought when he wrote it, to finde an <hi>A.

               <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> ſaith not one word for a <hi>Claſſicall Presbyterie,</hi> (the maine difference in hand) but for a <hi>Congregationall,</hi> that he would have in ſome things more managed by the Presbyteries of every Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without putting every thing to the vote of the people of the Congregation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe ſome <hi>confuſion</hi> hath followed upon it.

There was confuſion in the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Or is there any mention of this in the Apologie, that all buſineſſes of the Church muſt be put to the vote of the Congregation?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in that thing only there hath been an arguing on both ſides. M. <hi>Parker</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Noyſe</hi> only are mentioned in the letter, to be on the one ſide &amp; all the other Churches on the other, againſt Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Noyſe.</hi> And 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> doth not ſay he won the day, but as hee anſwered their Arguments (as he ſaith) ſo he confeſſeth they anſwered his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the thing is left to conſideration. Yea a godly man of New-England told me that the Churches of New-England did conceive that Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> had received full ſatisfaction from them in that point. How ever it were, all amounts but to a private letter ſubſcribed by one man, yet <hi>Imprimatur</hi> ſaith <hi>I. C.</hi> as if much to the purpoſe.

               <p>To any private copies or Manuſcripts from New-England, one Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> hath anſwered, as too much jumping with the Apologie and oppoſite to <hi>Claſſicall Presbytery.</hi> Another, if it had come forth, would have beene keener againſt <hi>A.

And for the third, it hath nothing at all for <hi>Claſſicall Presbyterie,</hi> but ſome things touching the ordering of Congregationall Presbyteries, and all theſe are but private intelligencers, and mutuall adviſers, not determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or nationall No more then, I ſuppoſe, Mr. <hi>Cranford</hi> or <hi>A.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:196793:6"/> Reply, to bee the ſenſe of New-England, though made by one of that Countrey.</p>
               <p>As for the letter of <hi>Zeland,</hi> I cannot tell how to ſpeak all the truth, &amp; not offend ſome, whom by my will I would not in the leaſt diſpleaſe. Sure this will not offend to tell <hi>A. S.</hi> that in <hi>Holland,</hi> if not in <hi>Zeland,</hi> are ſome Churches that are fully with the five Miniſters, unto which ſome of them doe relate. And to ſpeake theſe things to the Letter it ſelfe, being matters of fact, I hope cannot juſtly offend. 1. That that Letter came admirably punctuall upon the very nick after the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Apologie was out. 2. That a Scottiſh Knight (as it was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) nine or ten dayes before it was known abroad, that the letter was to come, ſaid, <hi>What if ye receive a Letter from Zeland, diſliking the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie?</hi> or to that effect. 3. That there is a Scottiſh Church (of which one <hi>Spang</hi> is a very buſie agent) at <hi>Trevere</hi> hard by <hi>Middleborough,</hi> whence the letter came. 4. That there are in it many high paſſages ſeeming to ſome ſo prejudiciall to our worthy Magiſtracy, that it juſtifies that of the Apology, ſaying, <hi>That the five Miniſters, &amp;c. give more to the Civil Magiſtrates, then tbe principles of ſome Presbyterians do.</hi> The ſaid letter giving ſo <hi>too little</hi> to the Magiſtracy, that the State of <hi>England,</hi> I think, cannot approve it here among us. <hi>Verbum ſapientiſat eſt.</hi> More may be thought, upon evident grounds, but not ſpoken here. 5. Moſt happily by almoſt a miraculary providence, in this nick of time, came two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from <hi>New-England</hi> to countermand Mr. <hi>Parkers</hi> Letter thence, and the other from <hi>Zeland.</hi>

               <p>The ſecond from another of <hi>New-England,</hi> to another Miniſter in <hi>Old-England</hi> about the ſame time, wherein we have theſe paſſages. <hi>We have had,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a Synod lately in our Colledge, wherein ſundry things were agreed on gravely, as, That the votes of the people are needfull in all admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and excommunications, at leaſt in way of conſent; all yeelding to act with their conſent.</hi> 2. <hi>That thoſe that are fit matter for a Church, though they are not alwayes able to make large and particular relations of the work and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith, yet muſt not live in the commiſſion of any known ſin, or the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of any known duty.</hi> 3. <hi>That conſociation of Churches in way of more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meetings yearly, and more private monethly or quarterly, as Conſultative Synods, are very comfortable and neceſſary for the peace and good of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:196793:7"/> 4. <hi>It was generally deſired that the exercitium of the Churches power might onely be in the Elderſhip in each particular Church, unleſſe their ſinnes be apparent in their worke.</hi> 5. <hi>That Pariſhes, Churches in old England, could not be right without a renewed Covenant at leaſt, and the refuſers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. And were not New-England ſo farre, the Churches of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land would ſoon ſend a third, punctually to approve the Apologie, unleſs it bee for their neerer compliance with them who notwithſtanding have written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have been the longer in anſwer to this clauſe, becauſe wee finde <hi>A.

               <p>The truth is, all Churches generally, partly by tyranny, and partly by Security, are grown ſo corrupt, that to apologize for a through reformation, ſeemes to reprove all, and ſo all are ready to be offended, that are leſſe reformed. We have heard of ſad ſtories of late, but true, (not teld in a corner) of the <hi>lamentable over-ſpreading of Popery, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, drunkenneſſe in ſome kingdomes, and adulterie, formality, &amp;c. in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> If we reforme but in part, by halves, imitating <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. towards the Pope, <hi>cutting off the head of Prelacie, and ſitting down in their Chaire (ſimilia non ſunt contraria)</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Had not the Abbeys been pulled downe, the <hi>Priories</hi> ſince had had opportunity to have riſen. Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> grinds the Idol to powder, that it might be quite aboliſhed.

The Popiſh (notwithſtanding a few Saints in <hi>ſecret</hi> here and there) are in a dependance on Antichriſt. 2. To charge it as a

If you diſſent not from them, you will never kindly diſſent from the intituled Mo. <hi>R. A. BB.</hi> and Rt. Rev. BB.

               </p>
               <p>A.

               </p>
               <p>M. S. If you ſpeake cordially, as ſuppoſing indeede that you may be better inſtructed, it had beene beſt for you to have ſtayd for the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies determination, or to have conferred with ſome of them you write againſt, before you had written and printed that deſperate ſpeech, leſt the inke ſeeme letters of blood to you at your dying pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. I warrant you, if what one, or many <hi>ſay onely,</hi> would make an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:196793:9"/> a multitude would ſay, <hi>that a coactive claſſicall Presbyterie would be the root of couched Prelacy, and Eccleſiaſticall tyrannie.</hi> But I will not be one of them to ſay ſo. <hi>Probatum eſt;</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> that which you call <hi>Independency,</hi> hath not procured, but cured, or purged out hereſies, ſchiſmes, formalitie, prophaneneſs, more then ſome other Kingdoms that ſo hate and hit at miſ-called <hi>Independency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. S. <hi>You ſue for a Toleration, and conſequently for a Separation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. S. So then, where Papiſts are tolerated, there they are Separatiſts too. It's but the Noun of multitude between, but that the <hi>Independents</hi> in <hi>England</hi> might tolerate, and the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> might be tolerated, would they then be <hi>Separatiſts?</hi> Who deſires ſeparation? but rather union in the truth. If any hold the truth, and ſtumble, though of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, at ſome ſmaller matters, (as you count them) it is your duty to ſuffer them, and to <hi>bear with the weak,</hi> and not <hi>offend the conſciences of Brethen;</hi> or Gods woe is by him pronounced againſt you.</p>
               <p>A. S. <hi>I may adde to all theſe, your undervaluing of the Parliaments great favour towards you. For yee know, brethren, how they, notwithſtanding your former ſeparation from all other Churches, &amp;c. invited you to be members of this Aſſembly, had they not given you the capacity, yee had been altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable. And not only that, but they honoured one of you with the high favour of ſending one of you with their Commiſſioners to</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>M. S. O abominable accuſation, O ſycophantiſing inſinuation! Who art. <hi>A. S.

Thy <hi>probation</hi> a ſilly phantaſie. Did ever any Vote of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or of the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> accuſe the Apologie of undervaluing the <hi>Parliaments</hi> favours? None but he that hath <hi>A. S.</hi> as part of his name, would ſay ſo. For all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet men ſee plainly, that as the <hi>form</hi> and ſtile of the Apologie is moſt ſweet; ſo the <hi>matter</hi> now in hand ſo much as is there intimated, is the Queſtion.

Yea, whether the whole draught of the Apologie be to be condemned or commended by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that is alſo a queſtion yet unreſolved, by <hi>Parliament, Aſſembly,</hi> and a conſiderable part of City and Kingdom.

               <p>M. S. Now, where is your <hi>Philoſophie?</hi> Is there an unreaſonable faculty in the reaſonable ſoul, that hath no light but by participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

               <p>M. S. Yet this man in his 1 <hi>Annot. pag.</hi> 4. ſaith, <hi>It comes very ſhort, is weak and ſlender, and no way ſatisfactory.</hi> The man makes nothing of contradictions, upon contradictions; for even here alſo is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or two more. Are the five Miniſters diſcourſe moſt learned, and yet errour too, as you ſaid in the beginning of your Epiſtle? And are they moſt learned, and yet leſs learned then you?</p>
               <p>But indeed (ſaith one) <hi>Hee makes a great noyſe of learning in his book, ratling his Sophiſtry-terms, ſo that though hee hath failed in his Divinity, Phyſick, and Philoſophie hitherto, yet hee will make us know that hee is a notable Logician; or he will make our ears ring with unengliſhed Ergoes,</hi> with <hi>A genere ad ſpeciem affirmativè,</hi> with <hi>A poſſe ad eſſe non valet conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentia; Non poſſibile eſt eſſe, poſſibile eſt non eſſe, totum, totaliter, materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliter,</hi>

For it is a ſad thing, ſaid he, that good men neer their end ſhould write ſome ſorry peece, to be a monument of their declining in their laſt dayes, and of their diſgrace before they are buried.</hi> As a worthy man a little afore his death, wrote in defence of ceremonies, for which formerly he had ſuffered.

               </head>
               <p>M. S. Truly called Interrogatories which A. S. puts to the five Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as if he were already gotten into the Chair, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A. S. His firſt Conſideration. Whether in any Eccleſiaſticall or Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Aſſembly of the Chriſtian world, wherein things are carried by plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of voices, it be ordinarie for any inconſiderable number thereof to joyn in a particular combination among themſelves, and therein to take particular reſolutions?</p>
               <p>M. S. We have heard of ſome Parliaments in Europe, that the Houſe of Peeres is ſo conſtitute, <hi>that if a vote paſſe where ſomes conſciences amongst them cannot yeeld to, they may modeſtly enter in the Houſe their diſsent from it.</hi> But whether this be ſo or not, the five Miniſters did not take particular reſolutions and publiſh them in print, to croſſe the proceedings and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes of the Aſſembly; or ſtate a queſtion yet unreſolved by the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but onely told the Kingdome <hi>de facto,</hi> what they had held and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and therfore in the Apologie ſpeak in the <hi>paſt time,</hi> with ſome very few and ſhort touches upon what ground.</p>
               <p>Wherein they declare themſelves to cloſe nearer with the Aſſembly, were they all Presbyterian (as we know the contrary) then thouſands ever thought they would.</p>
               <p>And withall they doe profeſſe themſelves ſo unwedded to their former <note place="margin">See Apol. p 10. It is their ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d golden rule by which they walked.</note> practiſes, and ſo far from over-weening their preſent judgements, that upon diſcovery of more light, they are moſt willing to open their eyes upon it, and let it in. And therefore you A. S. have done very ill, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them as much as in you is, from that ſweetneſſe of ſpirit, that hath appeared in all their writings and carriages.</p>
               <p>But our main anſwer to this your Conſideration (which makes it a groſſe inconſideration, if not untrurh) is this, That the Aſſembly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

               <p>A. S. his ſecond Conſideration, <hi>Whether in taking ſuch reſolutions, they ſhould not conſequently reſolve themſelves to quit the Aſſembly, and to appear as parties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. S. The antecedent was denied before on the firſt Conſideration: therefore the conſequence is deſtroyed. And for the <hi>conſequence</hi> or Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition it ſelfe, of the five <hi>Miniſters</hi> quitting the Aſſembly, and to appeare as parties, for ſetting forth the Apologie; I utterly diſlike your motion, as ſtriking at the worthy Commiſſioners of Scotland, as if they likewiſe ſhould quit the Aſſembly for replying to the Apologie. Men of a far better ſpirit then you are. And though they be ſomewhat ingaged in a ſetled Presbytery, yet carry themſelves more ſagely and moderatly, then many of our own men; an honour for them, and a ſhame for us.</p>
               <p>A. S. His fourth Conſideration (and for the third vaniſheth upon our anſwer to the firſt and ſecond) <hi>Whether this Apologeticall Narration was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, when yee found the calumnies, miſtakes, miſ-apprehenſions of your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and miſts that had gathered about you, or were rather caſt upon your perſons in your abſence, begin by your preſence againe, and the bleſſing of God upon you, to ſcatter and vaniſh, without ſpeaking a word for your ſelves and cauſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. S. Yea it was: For look but to the next full period afore; and you ſhall find that this you repeat as touching that ſcattering and vaniſhing of miſts, doth but relate to the people, and only to ſome of them, <hi>viz. Thoſe that profeſſe or pretend the power of godlineſs.</hi> Theſe mens ſerene ſpirits onely were the beams that began to ſcatter the miſts. And therefore the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts</hi> ſpeak diſtinctly and punctually (and not indefinitely as you) in the words you ſeem to quote; <hi>viz.</hi> they ſay that they found <hi>many</hi> (mark) <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of thoſe miſts, not <hi>all;</hi> and did but begin to ſcatter, as you your ſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:196793:12"/> The Apologiſts ſay, They did but <hi>begin</hi> to ſcatter. For in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Apologiſts, their motion was like the lowrings of an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant morning, the miſts aſcend, and anon deſcend, and by and by aſcend, and turn into a <hi>Scottiſh-</hi>miſt, as the <hi>Engliſt</hi> Proverb is, <hi>That will wet an Engliſh-man to the skin.</hi> The <hi>miſt went up by the hils; but</hi> (as the other Proverb is) <hi>down by the Mils,</hi> they turned into rain. What mean elſe thoſe words of the <note place="margin">Apo. pag. 1</note> Apologie; <hi>Our ears have been ſo filled with a ſudden and unexpected noyſe of confuſed exclamations, in the interpretation of moſt reflecting on us, that awakened thereby, we are inforced to anticipate a little that diſcovery of our ſelves, which we otherwiſe reſolved to have left to time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thoſe words of the Apologie: <hi>Whereas your ſilence upon all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apol. p. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>grounds, hath been by the ill interpretation of ſome, imputed either to our conſciouſneſs of the badneſs and weakneſs of our cauſe, or to our inability to maintain what we aſſert in difference from others, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thoſe words of the Apologie; <hi>Since the change of times from our exile,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apol. p. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>we have indured that which to our ſpirits is no leſs grievous; the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reproach of good men, even to the threatning of another baniſhment.</hi> No doubt but the Apologiſers know what they ſay, and what they can ſay, if called to ſpeak out. Beſides, if the people had let them alone, ſhould ſeem ſome Miniſters would not. O, it was an unhappy Anticipation (O, if the will of God had been to have prevented it) that in the very nick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Aſſembly met, that two Books ſhould foreſtall the Market, the one penned by a learned <hi>Scot,</hi> and the other by a learned <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> that ſet the tongues of men ſo a wame.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to vomit out upon the five Miniſters Tenet, and next to aſperſe their perſons, before the Aſſembly had made one Syllogiſme, <hi>Hinc illae la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymae.</hi> Hence the Apologie (poor meek thing) was forced to ſpeak; and thereupon <hi>A. S.</hi> ſo fiercly breathed (I had almoſt ſaid brayed) out againſt it ſo many bitter words.</p>
               <p>A. S. tels us in this his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Conſideration, <hi>of the honour the Parliament ſhewed the Apologiſts, in calling them to be members of the Aſſembly,</hi> which was enough to juſtifie their perſons from all aſperſions, without any Apologie.</p>
               <p>M. S. To this we anſwer; That they and their friends will ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Honourable <hi>Parliaments</hi> great reſpect to them. And ſo much the more, in theſe times wherein great <hi>A. S.</hi> and little, &amp;c. do ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to render them odious. But I think I ſhould not croſs the ſenſe of the <hi>Parliament</hi> if I ſhould not make it an univerſall <hi>major</hi> propoſition: That all whom the Honourable <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhall call to be members of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> vindicated from all aſperſions; and ſo to conclude, that all Epiſcopall Prelaticall men that in life and practiſe have been—if they ſhould be called to be of the Aſſembly, were <hi>eo nomine</hi> vindicated from all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:196793:13"/> aſperſions. I am ſure <hi>de facto</hi> that ſome very learned men were called by the ſweet indulgence of the honourable <hi>Parliament</hi> for the common good to be Members of the grave Aſſembly, who ſince upon better knowledge of them, are by the <hi>Parliament</hi> purged out of the Aſſembly (a good ridde, the Aſſembly is the better for their abſence) and ſome are at <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſee how <hi>terſe</hi> they be; and ſome in priſon, ſee how their memberſhip of the Aſſembly have vindicated them. Be ſure of it, that the choice of men for the Aſſembly was to find men good, not to make them ſo. And two wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Parliament</hi> men of a County may not know at firſt all the faults in every Town, or the lint on every black coat. And therefore ſince that, the worthy <hi>Parliament</hi> hath well bruſht ſome.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Parliament</hi> put never ſo much honour upon the five Miniſters in calling them to the Aſſembly; yet ſince many have aſperſed them, or ſome laboured how to make them odious to Kingdoms and Nations, and who but the order of <hi>A. S.</hi> mainly inſtigating? And therefore this fully anſwers to your laſt <hi>Quere</hi> in your fourth <hi>Conſideration.</hi> Whether this Apologie was neceſſary after the firſt cloud was neer over? every night muſt be cleared by a new riſe of the Sun.</p>
               <p>A. S. his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Conſideration, ſaith, That <hi>the five Miniſters do blame</hi> all <hi>Proteſtant Churches as not having the power of godlineſs, and the profeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with difference from carnall and formall Chriſtians, advanced and held forth among them as among</hi> you, <hi>which is commonly thought to be particularly intended againſt the</hi> Scots.</p>
               <p>M. S. Sure it is no otherwiſe commonly thought to be particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt the <hi>Scots;</hi> and generally to blame all Proteſtant Churches, then in or by your common ſenſe deriving <hi>ſpecies,</hi> vain ſeemings to your phantaſie, from your outward ſenſes an evill eye ill affected. For the Apologie calls our dear brethren the <hi>Scots,</hi> the more reformed Churches. And for the words <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>among you,</hi> whereby you would preſent them ſetting themſelves as an oppoſite member of diſtinction to all Proteſtant Churches, and blaming them all as undiſtinguiſhed from carnall and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Chriſtians, in compariſon of them and their five Churches; the words <hi>all</hi> and <hi>you,</hi> are forged and foyſted in by your ſelf, and ſo muſt go for very falſhoods charged upon them. The words of the Apologie are, 1. <hi>That</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apol. p. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>they, and many others had but obſerved touching the non-advance of the power of godlineſs, &amp;c.</hi> among ſome, <hi>what themſelves had generally acknowledged.</hi> The five Miniſters do not charge it, but repeat it as confeſſed by themſelves. 2. It is not ſaid it was confeſſed, and they obſerved there was <hi>no</hi> power of godlineſs, but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was not <hi>advanced.</hi> 3. Nor is it ſaid it was <hi>not advanced,</hi> but not advanced <hi>as in this our Iſland.</hi> This <hi>Iſland</hi> being a common phraſe, yea, and your phraſe too in the title of your Book, to ſignifie <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> both.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:196793:13"/>
               <p> And then where is that particular intendment againſt Scotland; or the five Miniſters laying their Churches in the ballance againſt other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, they ſpeake but <hi>indefinitely</hi> in a contingent matter, and therefore can bee conſtrued but of ſome particulars; and therefore did not ayme at <hi>all.</hi> You know how highly they eſteeme of <hi>New-England,</hi> and therefore that is not excluded from the advance of the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, as in this Iſland of great Britaine Engliſh and Scots are included. However, as no man that is a knowing man either by hearſay or travell over the next Sea, will accuſe Scotland as moſt carnall and formall (it were well for the world if in that, &amp;c. others had not farre exceeded them) ſo none of us, except Phariſees, will excuſe our Nations of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in advancing the power of godlineſſe in apparent view above carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and formalitie.</p>
               <p>You ſee by our anſwer to the Apologie, that not that Apologie but your <hi>will</hi> cauſed you to ſpeake that which is not by wiſe men once to bee mentioned at this time, as if the Apologiſts intended to ſay any the leaſt thing to grieve our brethren the Scots.</p>
               <p>A. S. his ſeventh Conſideration (for the ſixth is non-ſenſe, unleſſe we put the interrogatorie point at Anabaptiſts, and ſo <hi>A. S.</hi> to take unto him and them, hee ranks himſelfe with all, calling them <hi>us,</hi> I ſay, to take to him and them the Browniſts and Anabaptiſts to be of his partie. Reader, view his ſixth Conſideration, whether you can make ſenſe of it, I cannot, nor any thing of conſequence; therefore anſwer not unto it) his ſeventh Conſideration, I ſay, interrogates thus: <hi>Many are deſirous to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Apologeticall Narration publiſhed by you five alone, be in the name of your five alone, or of all thoſe alſo, or apart of thoſe whom ye pretend to hold your tenets: if in the name of you five onely, whether ye five can arrogate a power unto you ſelves to maintaine theſe tenets as the conſtant opinion of all your Churches; having no generall confeſſion of their faith thereabouts. If in the name of all the reſt, we deſire you would ſhew your Commiſſion from all your Churches, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. S. Good Reader doe but turne about theſe interrogatories, and put them to <hi>A. S.</hi> and put <hi>A. S.</hi> in ſtead of the five Miniſters, and you may kill <hi>Goliah</hi> with his owne ſword; if five Miniſters have arrogated in the Apol. one <hi>A. S.</hi> much more in his Reply. If <hi>A. S.</hi> doth not like the converſion; we anſwer poſitively.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's no arrogating for any Chriſtian upon juſt occaſion to make his confeſſion of faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The confeſſion of faith in doctrine that is in all the beſt reformed Churches is theirs; For one touching pure Diſcipline, it was not found in Scotland whiles the tyrannie of the Biſhops prevailed. Whiles things
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:196793:14"/> are in <hi>fieri,</hi> a wiſe man will not expect them <hi>in facto eſſe.</hi> Faith may bee when confeſſion dares not appeare. <hi>A. S.</hi> is angry with that confeſſion of faith in the Apologie, and hath opened the mouthes of many others (as we heare) ready to barke too at it, they doe but ſtay their turnes, why then doth he call for more confeſſion?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The godly learned Fathers, <hi>Tertullian, Juſtin Martyr, &amp;c.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no authority from men to Apologize for the truth; the Scripture they Apologized for, bore them out.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Parliament allow the five Miniſters more, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew their reaſons; therefore the leſſe, to ſhew their opinion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A thouſand and a thouſand good Chriſtians were glad to heare how the five Miniſters diſſented from the rigid Separation, and cloſed with the beſt reformed Churches (the ſole buſineſſe of the Apologie in effect) and thought that no good Proteſtants would have beene ſorry for them.</p>
               <p>A. S. <hi>His eight Conſid. interrogates the five Miniſters thus; Whether yee deſire a toleration for you five alone in</hi> your <hi>(marke</hi> your) <hi>Religion, for all the reſt? Item, if a toleration in publick, in erecting of Churches apart? or to live qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly without troubling of the State? As for the last, appearingly ye may have it unſought. But for the reſt, the Parliament is wiſe enough, and knoweth what is convenient for the Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. S. An Apologie for the Apologiſts Church-way. Toleration, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, is (ſaith learned <hi>Capel)</hi> of things unlawfull: His words are, <hi>The Law I know permitted uſury to the Jewes, to the ſtranger, what of that?</hi> It followes the rather, <hi>yet it is of it ſelfe a ſinne, becauſe permiſſion is of ſinnes, not of duties.</hi> Cap. Tempt. of Vſury. We are not, friend <hi>A. S.</hi> come to that yet. To yeeld the one, or beg the other. Wee challenge it as your duty that are Proteſtants, to allow us our liberty that are Proteſtants, and hold with you, in Doctrine and Diſcipline, alſo in <hi>ſubſtance;</hi> the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>an accident.</hi> 1. The <hi>quantitie;</hi> you would have it extended to <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies, provinciall Claſſes, &amp;c.</hi> over every Church, which appeares not in Scripture, either name or thing. Wee would have it bounded within e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular Church made up to competent hundreds, with a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie of Church Officers for parts and number. And 2. <hi>Neceſsity</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, for in appeales you would cite and conſtraine men to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid <hi>Colloquies</hi> &amp; <hi>Claſſes, &amp;c.</hi> For which there is not the leaſt in the Scriptures; we would have a free voluntary recourſe out of conſcience to the brotherly adviſe of neighbour Churches, or a Synod, dogmatically to declare Chriſts minde unto us, and in caſe of refuſall to ſubmit to their judgement, having no ground in Scripture to refuſe; the Adviſing Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to renounce communion with the offending Church; and the particular Church to pronounce <hi>excommunication</hi> againſt their offending
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:196793:14"/> brother. So that the difference is not in <hi>ente, ſed modo:</hi> not in the <hi>thing,</hi> but the <hi>manner</hi> rather. We ſay therefore, it is your duty to give us our own, our liberty, as much (if not more) as we to let you alone, whiles both parties avouch that they are unconvinced as yet, of a poſſibility of a neerer agreement.

               <p>The <hi>Amorites</hi> gently intreated <hi>Abraham</hi> and his family, and were confederate with them, Gen. 14. 13. So did the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> or men of <hi>Gerar,</hi> Gen. 20. And before both, the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> Gen. 12. 19. So did the men of <hi>Gerar</hi> deale with <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 26. The <hi>Sechemites</hi> ſaid they would kindly intreat <hi>Jacob</hi> and his ſons, becauſe they were peaceable, Gen. 34. 20, &amp;c. The <hi>Egiptians</hi> appoint <hi>Goſhen</hi> for the Iſraelites, to dwell peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in the midſt of Egypt. The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> or <hi>Babylonians</hi> at length allow the Jewes the libertie of their religion, with all accommodations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>Nehem.</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> throughout. Compare 2 Chron. 36. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> likewiſe bare with the Jewes, and their Judaiſme for many yeares both before and after Chriſts time.

               <p>But <hi>(Reader)</hi> when ſhall we ſee an end of theſe diſputes in the world? and when ſhall the names of Presbyterian &amp; Independent (with all others of the like troubleſome and jarring importance) ceaſe from amongſt us?</p>
               <p>I cannot propheſie unto thee the juſtneſs of the time, when this great wonder ſhall be; but ſome few ſignes of this time approaching (if ever it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:196793:19"/> ſhall approach) I conceive I am able to inform thee.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when men ſhall begin to grow to a clearneſs, ſingleneſs, honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and Chriſtian-like greatneſs in their ends, making themſelves and their own intereſts, their foot-ſtool, and the glory of God, and the publike accommodation of the world, their throne; this is one great ſign that that golden age we ſpeak of, is at the door. The reaſon is, becauſe there is no hope (ſcarce a poſſibility) of a general accord amongſt men in any degree conſcientious, but in the truth, or mind of God revealed in the Scriptures. No other band is like ever to gather them all, or hold them longer faſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The reaſon of this is, becauſe in a great ſociety or communion of men, worſhipping God aright, (I mean with uprightneſſe of heart) it is ſeldome or never ſound, but that ſome of them, fewer or more, have the truth of God revealed to them, ſome in one point, and others in another, and that with ſuch aſſurance, or evidence of underſtanding, that no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or reaſonings to the contrary whatſoever are able to remove them, or alter their judgements therein. So that except all the reſt ſhall come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto them, and joyn with them in ſuch particulars as theſe, there is no poſſibility of a thorough union in judgement between them. Now there is no way, means, or method more probable and hopefull to bring men to the knowledge of the truth, or (which is the ſame) of the mind of God delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Scriptures, in all things, then that ſimplicity or Chriſtian noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit (which we ſpake of) in their ends. The reaſon is, becauſe the tenour, frame and conſtituting principles of the Scriptures are caſt, moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ordered by him that is the great Author of them, on purpoſe to comport and fall in with ſuch ends, as were mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> his own glory, and the publike accommodation of men from every particular: and on the contrary, to oppoſe, thwart, and croſs every man in all his perſonall and particular ends whatſoever, which have not a perfect &amp; intire conſiſtence with thoſe other. So that he that is inſpired, acted, and led by thoſe high and noble ends, the magnifying of God, and doing good to the community of men, can have no occaſion or tentation at any time upon him to bow, ſtrain, force, or wreſt any Scripture, becauſe in their native and proper ſenſe and tendencie, they comply with him, and (as the Hebrew phraſe is) ſpeak to his heart; whereas on the contrary, if men be ingaged in ſelf-ends and aims, which are incompliant with the glory of God, and the general good of men, as when they make theſe their foot-ſtool, and their own honor or greatneſs, their throne, they have a ſtrong tentation, amounting to little leſs then a neceſſity upon them, to deal violently with the Scriptures, to bend and ſtrain, and force them out of their owne rectitude and ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe otherwiſe they wil not countenance or comply with them in their crooked ends, but condemn them.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:196793:19"/>
               <p> He that intends to make hoops of a clean ſtreight-bodies tree, muſt in the working of it alter the comely ſhape and ſtreightneſſe of it, wherein it grew, and bend, and crook, and bow quite round, all that he imployeth of it to ſuch a purpoſe, whereas he whoſe Art and intent is to make Javelins, Lances, Pikes, or the like, of ſuch a tree, hath no occaſion to alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſhape or figure of it in point of ſtreightneſſe, becauſe Nature it ſelf had fitted it to his hand in this reſpect for ſuch uſes and purpoſes as theſe; nay, this man ſhould do againſt himſelfe, if he ſhould alter them: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they who ſeeke themſelves in wayes and ends which contradict the lawfull peace and comforts of other men, if withall they deſire to have their proceedings countenanced and atteſted by the Scripture for juſt and good, they muſt of neceſſity ſuborn them, and make them ſpeak what the holy Ghoſt never meant they ſhould ſpeak; whereas thoſe men who value not, regard not themſelves but in their order and due ſubordination, and are willing to gird themſelves and ſerve, til God and men have firſt eaten, and can be content with the reverſions and broken meat of their table, be they never ſo mean; theſe men (I ſay) need not ſolicit or importune the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures for their teſtimony or compliance with them in their way, becauſe their native inſpiration from God, leads them willingly, yea rejoycingly, yea triumphantly hereunto. Such men ſhould but prevaricate with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their own ends, if they ſhould go about to make one haire of the head of the Scripture, either black or white, which the holy Ghoſt hath not made ſuch to their hand. Therefore whiles ſome men ſhall ſeeke to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn their own names and reputations with the plunder and ſpoyls of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens, and lay the foundations of their owne greatneſſe in the rulnes of the lawfull comforts and peace of others, there is no hope of a generall or through accommodation in matters of religion. It is impoſſible that ſuch men ſhould comport with the truth in their way, and conſequently with thoſe who embrace the truth. Nor will any method of violence, as either impriſoning, fining, cruſhing, ſuppreſſing, baniſhing cutting off by death, or the like, be able to advance that unity and accord which we al luſt after, though ſome in Gods way, others in their own: the very ghoſts, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and memories of thoſe that ſhal ſuffer in any of theſe kinds, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God, will be as ſo many ſpirits of diviſions, diſſentions, and diſtractions amongſt thoſe that will chuſe no other Arbitrators to comprimize, their differences, but the <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another figne of thoſe Halcyon days approaching, ſo much deſired by us all, wherin all guſts, and winds, &amp; ſtorms of contrary doctrines, opinions, and Sects in religion, ſhal be turned into a ſweet calm of an univerſal unity and accord, is this: when Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, ſhall be no more turned into Councels, Synods, and ſecular Armes: I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:196793:20"/> mean, when men ſhall be freely permitted, without feare or danger of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation, to conſult with the Apoſtles, Prophets, &amp;c. of what religion it were beſt for them to be, without having their judgments emancipated, foreſtalled and over-awed by the definitive, and compulſory determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and allowances of other men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon hereof is, becauſe the writings of the Apoſtles, Prophets, &amp; Evangeliſts, with the Miniſtery of faithfull Paſtors and Teachers, are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and ſet apart by God, for this very end and purpoſe, namely, <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Saints, &amp;c. till they all come into the unity of the Faith, &amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whilſt Councels, Synods, &amp;c. ſhall intrude, or ſtep in, as new Apoſtles, <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4 13.</note> Prophets and Evangeliſts, of another order, between thoſe Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Evangeliſts, and thoſe Paſtors and Teachers, which Chriſt hath given for the ſetling of an univerſall peace and unity throughout all the Churches of his Saints, in due time, to interrupt &amp; intercept them in their work and way, ſo that they can never have the judgments &amp; conſciences of men in their native ingenuity and freedome to work upon, but ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſadvantage of Synodical impreſſions and foreſtallments, partly with fear, partly with favour, partly with hope and conceit of the truth, there is little hope of ſeeing the viſion of joy and glory in the world, I mean the Saints and Servants of Jeſus Chriſt univerſally kiſſing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing one another in the armes of unity, truth and peace. It is in vain to waſh in <hi>Abanah</hi> or <hi>Pharphar,</hi> when onely the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the cure. To commit adultery, is not the way to increaſe, though fleſh and blood ſhould determine for it. <hi>They ſhall eate</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and not have enough: they ſhall commit adultery and not increaſe, becauſe they have left off to take heed unto the Lord,</hi> that is, becauſe they had ſubſtituted their own wiſdome and inventions in ſtead of his, for bringing their deſires and ends to paſſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) when the generality of men profeſſing godlineſs and religion, ſhall be content to furniſh themſelves with religion (I mean with knowledge in religion) by ſmaller parcels, as the ſtock of their own judgements and underſtanding ſhall be able from time to time to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate them, and ſhall make ſcruple of taking it up by whole ſale from Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, Councels, and Books, only for eaſe and cheapneſs ſake: this alſo is as the putting forth of the Fig-tree, which ſhewes the Summer of an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall accord amongſt the Saints, to be at hand. The reaſon is, becauſe God hath promiſed (and will perform accordingly) that <hi>if men ſhall apply their heart to underſtanding, and ſhall cry after knowledge, and ſeek her as ſilver, and ſearch for her as for hid treaſure, they ſhall then underſtand the feare of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God,</hi> Prov. 2. 2, 3, 4. But there is no promiſe made, that they who to favour themſelves, and to gratifie the fleſh, and to ſave the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:196793:20"/> labour of ſeeking and ſearching after knowledge, ſhall take in the dictates and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of men, and call them <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>underſtanding,</hi> without any more adoe, ſhall either find <hi>the fear of the Lord,</hi> or true <hi>knowledge of God.</hi> Now till men ſhall generally <hi>find the fear of the Lord,</hi> and the true <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> (which is not like to be out of that way, which the promiſe of God mentioned hath ſanctified thereunto) there will be little hope of the generall meeting of men in the bond of peace, as was formerly argued in another of theſe ſignes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, when Chriſtian States, and men of ſoundeſt judgment, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt learning, parts and abilities therein, ſhal give free liberty to men look'd upon as oppoſite in judgment to the truth, to publiſh and openly declare the grounds &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their judgments in each particular, and not compell them either to keep them burning or glowing in their own breaſts, or elſe to propagate and vent them privatly, and amongſt perſons that have neither learning nor abilities in any kind, to encounter or oppoſe them; this is another hopefull ſigne that the dayes of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall accommodation in matters of religion, are comming upon the world.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this is plain, becauſe till truth reigne among the Saints, Peace is not like to reigne, (the reaſon whereof hath been already given) nor will Truth ever reigne like unto herſelf, till all her enemies (I mean errors and miſpriſions in matters of Religion) be ſubdued and brought under her feet. Nor is there any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood in a way of reaſon or ordinary providence, that ſuch enemies of the truth ſhould ever be ſubdued, til they come to look thoſe ſons of Truth in the face, who are anointed by God with a ſpirit of wiſdome and underſtanding, for the confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and utter aboliſhment of them. Doubtleſſe one main reaſon why errours, and fond and foul opinions do ſtill propagate &amp; prevail with ſo high an hand amongſt us, is, becauſe theſe Miniſters and Teachers are ſuffered to have none other vent for them, but only amongſt people that are children in underſtanding, and not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſtrength of knowledge, or parts of learning to withſtand them. The common proverb hath ſomwhat in it to this purpoſe; <hi>Inter eaecos etiam luſcus poteſt regna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> meet, or Chriſtian, that the civill Magiſtrate, ſhould immediately, hand over head, without diſtinction, without ſearching (for his owne ſatisfaction) into the equitableneſſe, and lawfulneſſe of what a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie or Synod ſhall commend unto him for execution, intereſſe himſelfe in the execution of whatſoever ſhall be ſo recommended and preſented unto him? I preſume <hi>A.

Yet pag. 8. he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendeth ſo low, as to number himſelfe amongſt thoſe, who <hi>know that they know but in part:</hi> and pag. 9. amongſt thoſe that are <hi>conſcious of their owne infirmity:</hi> which principle if he would pleaſe to follow home, it would teach him to caſt away the greateſt part of his diſcourſe with indignation, and to ſay unto it, <hi>get thee hence.</hi> If he grants a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of errour or unrighteouſneſſe in the reſults and awards, whether of his Presbytery or Aſſembly, which are ſuppoſed to be tranſmitted to the Magiſtrate for execution; he cannot, ſpeaking like a man, deny him a lawfulneſſe of power, no nor yet a neceſſitie by way of duty, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and judge them, whether they bee lawfull or meet to bee put in execution, or no. And he that hath a power to judge and to determine, what is meet to be done, or not done, executed, or not executed, in matters of Religion, may bee ſaid to have a <hi>Directive power</hi> in ſuch things (at leaſt in the common ſenſe and notion of a <hi>Directive</hi> power) as well as an Executive.

If by a <hi>Directive power,</hi> he meanes a liberty or power of conſidering, adviſing, and propoſing of what may be expedient to be done in matters of Religon, and for the good of the Church; I know no man but is intereſſed in ſuch a power: As when the Tabernacle was to be built, every man had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to bring and offer what hee had, and what his heart ſerved him to part with for ſuch a purpoſe, towards the edification and furniſhing of it. But why this liberty or power ſhould be denied unto the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:196793:22"/> or Civill Magiſtrate, upon whom principally the charge lyeth to provide quietneſſe and peace for the Churches within the verge of their temporall juriſdiction; reaſon (doubtleſſe) on this ſide the Moone there lyeth none; and <hi>A.

If the Presbyterians demand ſuch a <hi>Directive</hi> power as this, let them ask the Crowne, Throne, and Kingdome of Chriſt alſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If by a <hi>Directive power</hi> he means, a prudentiall faculty or ability, <label type="milestone">

S.</hi> his Presbytery or Synod, (alwayes provided that the conſtituting members of either, be of a ſound conſtitution, as well for ſpirituall wiſedome, as for meekneſſe and humility) ſo is it not by <hi>A.

And if this be the Directive power which he meanes, though he ſeeks to allure the Parliament from the claim of it, by faſtening a complementall commendation of modeſty upon them, by way of exchange for it, proclaiming it unto the world, that they <hi>doe not arrogate it to themſelves;</hi> yet they doe claim it, yea, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, act, and make uſe of it, from day to day, as occaſion requireth. 1. In contriving and publiſhing their Ordinance for calling the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (formerly mentioned) they exerciſed ſuch a power, as we now ſpeak of. 2. In limiting thoſe that were to be of the Aſſembly, to the ſubject or Argument, on which it was permitted unto them to debate and treat (as appeares by the Ordinance they did) they did no leſſe. 3. In appointing and ordering them not to determine or conclude of things as they pleaſed by plurality of votes, but <hi>to deliver their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and advices as ſhould be moſt agreeable to the word of God</hi> (another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo in the Ordinance) they did the ſame. 4. In injoyning them, <hi>in caſe</hi>

                  <hi>of difference of opinions between them, to preſent the ſame, together with the reaſons thereof, unto both Houſes</hi> (another member of that Ordinance) they did every whit as much. 5. In their nomination and calling ſuch and ſuch Miniſters or Divines by name, and not others, to bee of the Aſſembly, they acted the ſame power. 6. In framing the temper and conſtitution of the Aſſembly, allaying it with ſuch and ſuch members of their own, they ſteer'd the ſame courſe. 7. And laſtly (to omit many other particulars of like conſideration) in their meſſages or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections ſent unto them from time to time, how to proceed, what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars to wave for the preſent, what to fall upon, and to debate, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the iſſue of their conſultations, with the like, what doe they elſe but claim and exerciſe ſuch a <hi>Directive power in matters of Religion,</hi> as we laſt diſtinguiſhed?</p>

                  <hi>Religion,</hi> beſides theſe three, my ſoule hath not yet entred into that his ſecret; but waits for his opening a doore unto me by which it may. He taxeth the Apologiſts once and again for generalities, and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in their expreſſions: But he that ſaith, <hi>A man ſhould not ſteal, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſacriledge</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas harping ſtill upon the ſame ſtring, (the ſound whereof <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> is ſo melodious in his own eares, how harſh ſoever in other mens) he chargeth the Apologiſts, for <hi>going againſt the Parliaments intention,</hi> in caſe they think, <hi>that they ſhould judge of queſtions in debate between them and their brethren;</hi> ſurely he ſpeaks rather as he would have it, then as he hath any ground to ſpeake. If he had plowed with their Heifer, conſulted with their expreſſions of themſelves in reference to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in this kind, he would have aſſoyled their riddle farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. For to what purpoſe ſhould they injoyne the Aſſembly (as we lately heard they doe in the Ordinance mentioned) <hi>in caſe of difference of opinions between them, to preſent the ſame, together with the reaſons therof, unto both Houſes of Parliament,</hi> if they had no intention to umpire or judge between them? Have they a deſire to look upon ſuch differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as ſome rare ſight, or pleaſant ſpectacle, onely to ſolace and delight themſelves with them? And why doth the tenour of their delegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of power to the Aſſembly, run in this ſtrain, <hi>To deliver their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and advices, as ſhould be moſt agreeable to the word of God?</hi> Do's any man deſire the opinion and advice of another in any matter that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him, without any intention of conſidering or judging of them?</p>
               <p>But <hi>A. S.</hi> is as cunning as <hi>A. C.</hi> and would fain commend his care <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> and tenderneſſe over the Parliament, in the things of their honour and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:196793:23"/> peace, by inſinuating unto them a non-vocation from God, to doe any thing with their judgments and underſtanding <hi>in matters of Religion,</hi> but all things (without exception) with their hand and power, that the Aſſembly, whether out of their judgments or affections, ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or <hi>dictate</hi> unto them. <hi>A. S.</hi> (I believe) is a brother of the ſtronger ſide of the Aſſembly; otherwiſe it is every whit as much to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he would have Arminianiz'd as much, if not far more then the Apologiſts have done. But if the Parliament hath no calling from God, to judge of matters between the Apologiſts and their Brethren (the Aſſemblers) I would willingly know who hath? or whether it be reaſonable, that the Apologiſts matters yet remaining undecided, and unjudged between them and their Brethren, ſhould ſuffer as men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, only becauſe their adverſaries and accuſers (the Brethren yee wot of) are more in number then they, and will needs continue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to them? Our Saviours teſtimony concerning himſelfe and his own cauſe, was a thouſand times more authentique and valid then the teſtimony of never ſo many men, take the beſt of the whole gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is in theirs; and yet he ſaid, <hi>If I beare witneſſe of my ſelfe, my witneſſe is not true,</hi> (Joh. 5. 31.) That is, it is not formally, or in a legall interpretation, true; it is not true upon any ſuch termes, but that you may reaſonably wave it, if you apprehend that you have grounds to do it. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is another that beareth witneſs of me, &amp;c.</hi> The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of a thouſand men in a caſe which equally (or though it bee with ſome inequality) concernes themſelves, is of no more validitie or authoritie, then of a particular man, in a caſe relating onely to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Yea, a good mans conſcience, in matters relating unto himſelfe, is never in more danger of ſuffering, then in a crowd, concern'd in the ſame manner with him. It is the ſaying of one, that <hi>etiam ex timidiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis animalibus acris multitudo cogi poteſt,</hi> that is, you may make a fierce company of the fearfulleſt creatures that are, if you put enough of them together; ſo frequent experience ſheweth, that <hi>etiam ex aequiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis hominibus iniqua multitudo cogi poteſt;</hi> you may make a bad aſſembly, of the beſt men.</p>

                  <hi>one cauſe cannot be granted to thoſe that have no authoritative power one over another:</hi> and that <hi>Par in Parem non habet imperium.</hi> Therefore why ſhould the Apologiſts fall in judgement by the hand of thoſe that are parties, and but equall to them? Again, It is his own reaſoning, <hi>pag.</hi> 45. <hi>If all Churches were equall</hi> (as for ought I know, or that <hi>A. S.</hi> alledgeth to the contrary, they are) <hi>there can neither be ſuperiours nor</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:196793:23"/> 
                  <hi>inferiours, and conſequently no obedience or diſobedience.</hi> And if <hi>Juſtice conſiſteth not in an Arithmeticalls but Geometrical, proportion</hi> (which is his own ſaying, <hi>pag.</hi> 70. and ſomewhat more rationall and leſs Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, then moſt of it's fellows are) then is there no reaſon, that perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorineſs of vote, how Arithmetically ſo ever priviledged, but weight and worth of argument, ſhould carry it againſt them. Which how it may fall, when God ſhall cancell or reverſe the Sciptures that now are, and make a new revelation of himſelf unto the world, I know not; but whileſt theſe ſtand, confident I am, that they will never ſo fall.</p>
               <p>But why the man ſhould deny the Parliament a calling to judge of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> matters between the Apologiſts &amp; their Brethren, when as every other man in the Kingdome hath a calling, yea, and ſomewhat more then a calling, a ſpeciall and weighty neceſſity to do it, (though not after the ſame manner in reſpect of the conſequence of their judgement) I ſee as little reaſon, as I do for twenty and ten things more aſſerted by him. Would <hi>A. S.</hi> have even the meaneſt of men to ſing obedience and ſubmiſſion to the Aſſembly without their underſtandings? Alas, they could make no melodie in their hearts unto God with ſuch a ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nor would the ſong be either honourable or comfortable to the Aſſembly it ſelf, if themſelves and others would but pleaſe to beſtow a few ſerious thoughts upon it. The glory of a Synod lies not ſo much in the ſtrength of their concluſions, as of their premiſſes: nor is it any thing worthy to be preſumed, in compariſon of what it is to be known, to be wiſe and upright men. Me thinks an Aſſembly of conſcientious and learned men, ſhould rather count it a prophanation of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions and reſolves, then otherwiſe, to have them ſwallowed without chewing; to have them ſubſcribed and conſented unto only in ſuch a way, and upon ſuch terms, as fools are wont to believe, ſubſcribe, and conſent unto all things: But,</p>

It is dangerous medling with Saints in any other way, then of tenderneſs and love, be they never ſo few in number, never ſo weak in power, or otherwiſe <hi>(one of theſe little ones,</hi> ſaith Chriſt); All the 21. Reaſons, with 41. more put to them, whereby <hi>A. S.</hi> incites the Parliament againſt a toleration of the Apologiſts, with men of their judgement, in the ſequele of his diſcourſe; will not deliver either the King or Parliament out of the hand of that threatning, if they come under the dint of it, by offering any violence (ſhall I ſay?) yea, any offence to the leaſt of theſe little ones. The Holy Ghoſt (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24.) propheſieth of <hi>the putting down of all rule, and all authority and power by Chriſt:</hi> the reaſon thereof, in the words immediatly following, hee ſheweth to be, their enmity unto him; <hi>for hee muſt reign,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25.) <hi>till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.</hi> The truth is, that it is a very hard matter, even for the beſt of men, in places of rule, authority and power, to move regularly in their own orb, and not to miſtake, or ſtrain beyond the tenour of their commiſſion, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle in the affairs of Chriſt, conſidering, firſt, that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with their own infirmities, as well as other men: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reſpect of their callings, they are compaſſed about with more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations this way, then other men: thirdly, (and laſtly) which is as much, or more then both the former, (if they be Chriſtians) what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the inſinuations and flatteries of the baſer, and the inconſiderate affections and favour of the better ſort of Teachers, they are taught to daſh their foot againſt this ſtone, as if it were another crown of glory to them.</p>
               <p>But let us firſt ſee, what that <hi>executive,</hi> or <hi>coercive</hi> (if it be lawfull to <label type="milestone">

               <p>For the firſt, hee deſcribes and ſtates this power, after this manner,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:196793:27"/> 
                  <hi>(pag.</hi> 6.) <hi>The Parliament pretends no Directive power in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—nor any executive power that is intrinſecall to the Church—but only an executive, coercitive, and externall power, which is not in, but about the Church, and for the Church, whereby it compelleth refractory men to obey the Church. And this authority belongs actually and in effect,</hi> in actu exercito, <hi>(as they ſay) to true Chriſtian Magiſtrates; but to others potentially,</hi> in actu ſignato; <hi>and</hi> jure in rem <hi>only, till they become true Chriſtians, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this deſcription the man is to me a Barbarian (his own phraſe to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> the Apologiſts) in the word, <hi>Church.</hi> I have beſtowed thoughts more then a few to be partners with him in his notion of the word; but <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to plus cogito, eo minus capio.</hi> For ſhame <hi>A.

A man in reaſon would think, that the ſame word, being uſed four or five times (and that without the leaſt intimation of any variety or difference of ſignification) almoſt within the compaſſe of ſo many lines, were ſtill meant, and to be taken in one and the ſame ſenſe. If ſo, then ha with you. The Parliament, <hi>by that coercitive power,</hi> which you are pleaſed here to beſtow upon it, by way of compenſation for that directive power which you take from it, <hi>compelleth</hi> (ſay you) <hi>refractory men to obey the Church:</hi> I preſume that by the <hi>Church</hi> here, you do not mean all the particular Churches and Congregations in the kingdome in the <hi>folio</hi> of their reſpective mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but in the <hi>decimo ſexto</hi> of their Synod, repreſentative Aſſembly. If you take the word in the former ſenſe, you only ſay, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath power to compell the refractory to obey all the particular Churches, with their ſeverall members in the Kingdome; which is a ſenſe (I conceive) at as much defiance with your ends, as with your and our underſtandings. If you take it in the latter (which I doubt not but is your beloved ſenſe) then your meaning is, that the uſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of that <hi>executive coercive power in matters of Religion,</hi> which you put into the Parliaments hands, is to compell the kingdome, in caſe it be refractory, or <hi>tot quot,</hi> to obey the Presbyterie, and Presbyteriall aſſemblies in all their Canons, Determinations, and Decrees what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, without bail or mainpriſe, without mercy or compaſſion, whether a man findes ſap, ſenſe, ſavour, reaſon or Religion in them or no.</p>
               <p>But yet ſecondly, I know not well how you ſhould mean the <label type="milestone">

               <p>For the firſt: The <hi>Magiſtrates power</hi> (ſaith he) viz. <hi>in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> (for ſo he muſt neceſſarily be underſtood, by the Antitheſis in the former clauſe or member of this Diſtinction, where he denies a <hi>Directive power</hi> unto him, <hi>in matters of Religion) is not in, or intrinſecall to the Church, but extrinſecall and about the Church.</hi> Is it <hi>in,</hi> i. <hi>intrinſecall</hi> to matters of Religion; and but <hi>extrinſecall</hi> in reſpect of the Church? So then (it ſeems) <hi>A.

By this diſtinction he hath utterly diſgrac'd his Presbyteriall Government, by making the Churches under it, more internall and inward, then the religion that is to be found in them.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:196793:31"/> counter-poyſings whatſoever, <hi>termini aequipollentes</hi> in his Logique. And if this be his meaning, the king (to be ſure) hath none of his <hi>power</hi> as yet, <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> and <hi>jure in re;</hi> nor hath the Parliament (at leaſt for ought <hi>A.

And whatſoever it hath done hitherto, by any <hi>execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, coercive, externall</hi> power <hi>about the Church</hi> or Church-affairs (in which kinde it hath done very much) depends as touching the validity and juſtifiableneſs of it upon this ſuppoſition, that it Presbyterializeth. Whence it followeth, that he that cannot, or doth not believe that the Parliament is of a Claſſique inclination, cannot (with the leave of <hi>A. S.</hi> his diſtinction) judge them to have done lawfully or warrantably any thing that they have done hitherto, about, or for the Church.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that till <hi>A.

Nor do I make much queſtion, but that wee ſhall have twenty Diſtinctions more, before we ſhall obtain that Definition.</p>
               <p>But of all the three diſtinctions here upon the ſtage, the beſt dancer <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Though I have many times heard of the diſtinction, <hi>in actu exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cito, &amp; in actu ſignato,</hi> yet I never heard of any thing belonging to a perſon <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> but that belonged to him, and that <hi>per prius, in actu ſignato.</hi> Hee to whom the principle or power of acting doth not belong, cannot ſtand ingaged for the exerciſe or acting of ſuch a power.</p>

               <q>What I finde not any where, I believe to be no where.</q>
               <p>I have ſearched, and that ſomewhat narrowly, throughout the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> whole volume of his Diſcourſe, to finde ſomething, that with any indulgence of imagination might be conceived to look like a proof of this his opinion, and can finde none, ſave only that poor one, of the examples of the Kings of <hi>Juda (pag.</hi> 63) inforc'd after this manner; <hi>It is the Civill Magiſtrates part to take away Hereſies, Superſtitions, and corruptions in manners after the examples of the Kings of</hi> Juda. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then is it not his duty likewiſe to take away all Schiſmes which are the high way to</hi> (and ſometimes from) <hi>Hereſie, and conſequently to deny Toleration, which is a way to both?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, neither you nor I, muſt be offended, to have a mole-hill of proof given us for a mountain of concluſion. You muſt know it is the manner of the Presbyterian School, to hang great weights upon ſmall wyars. For what need Dictators argue? But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be the Magiſtrates part to take away <hi>Superſtitions, Hereſies, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> ſure it is his part alſo to make himſelf able to diſcern ſuperſtitions and hereſies from the true worſhip and truths of God. Hee is to ſerve God in ſuch a practice, with his own underſtanding, and not by the Proctorage of Presbyterie (as you tell the Apologiſts, <hi>pag.</hi> 48. that they muſt <hi>not ſerve God by a Proctor)</hi> and if ſo, you muſt untruſs, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:196793:32"/> deliver back again to him that <hi>Directive power</hi> in matters of Religion, which you lately took from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Magiſtrate <hi>takes</hi> away Superſtition, Hereſie, &amp;c. hee <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> had need have better ſecurity then a Synod can give him, to ſave him harmleſs, in caſe he ſhould <hi>miſtake,</hi> and ſmite the truth of God, in ſtead of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and the true worſhip of God in ſtead of <hi>Superſtition. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Act 5. 24. 28. 38, 39.</note> might have had the full Vote of a Synod or Councell, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the <hi>Superſtition, Schiſme</hi> and <hi>Hereſie</hi> of the Apoſtles; but this was not ſecurity enough to him; he was afraid of <hi>fighting againſt God,</hi> this notwithſtanding. And for my part, when the civill Magiſtrate ſhall be far enough out of this danger of <hi>fighting againſt God,</hi> I have nothing to ſay againſt his fighting with Superſtition, Hereſie, Schiſme, corruptions in manners, &amp;c. Only my prayer for him unto God is, that hee would give him a wife and underſtanding heart, to conſider and diſcern, whether uſurpation over the judgements and conſciences of the Saints of God, in matters of Religion, be not as grand <hi>a corruption in manners</hi> as a Church or Kingdom is lighly incident unto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the examples of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> for want of better <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> arguments, are ſo much importun'd to ſpeak a good word for that <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive coercive power</hi> in the Civill Magiſtrate, with which <hi>A. S.</hi> would truk with him for that Directive power (before ſpoken of) let us conſider with a little more freedome and ingenuity, what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute thereunto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We do not read that any of the good Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> ever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any violence to the true Prophets, or people of the Lord, except it were in paſſion, as a <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 10. where <hi>Aſa</hi> is ſaid to have been <hi>wroth with the Seer,</hi> that admoniſhed him, and to <hi>have put him in priſon.</hi> Which fact of his I think <hi>A. S.</hi> himſelf will be aſham'd to preſent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Kings or Parliaments for imitation. Therefore whatſoever beſides may be prov'd from the example of the <hi>Kings of Judah in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion,</hi> towards the rearing up of a Presbyterie in the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its glory; certain it is, that nothing can be proved, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting, annoying, cruſhing, diſgracing, baniſhing, fining the Apologiſts, whom himſelf (more then once or twice) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth for very pious, godly, and learned men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither did any of theſe Kings ever compell any man to be of the Jewiſh Religion; nor yet to profeſs the Jewiſh Religion againſt their judgements. It was permitted to perſons of other Nations to live amongſt them, without being circumciſed, yea, or without ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for want of it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:196793:33"/> 3. Nor do we reade, that ever they attempted any thing againſt any <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>20</label> Sectaries or Schiſmatiques (as <hi>A. S.</hi> would call them) which yet aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in great variety and numbers amongſt them. We do not finde, that ever they finde impriſon'd, baniſhed, put to death, either Scribes, or Phariſees, or Herodians, or perſons of any other Sect in the profeſſion of the Jewiſh Religion, that lived peaceably in their State. Idolatry and Idolaters were (it ſeems) the adaequate object of their <hi>coercive power</hi> in matters of Religion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor did they, nor were they to inflict any outward puniſhment, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>21</label> upon every kinde of Idolater, though of the Jewiſh both Nation and Religion; as firſt, not upon covetous perſons, who yet are a kinde of Idolater, <hi>Epbeſ.</hi> 5. 5. Nor ſecondly, upon thoſe that worſhipped the true God of Iſrael, though with ſome violation of the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, as when they ſacrificed in the high places, &amp;c. But, firſt, upon ſuch only, who apoſtatiz'd from the God of Iſrael, to ſerve ſtrange gods, the gods of other Nations: And yet ſecondly, not upon ſuch neither, ſimply as ſuch, but as attempting to intice and draw away other of the people of God unto the ſame Idolatries with them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 5, 8, 9.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There are two reaſons very conſiderable, why the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>22</label> might be inveſted by God with a larger power in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then Kings or Magiſtrates under the Goſpel have any ground or warrant to claim from them. Firſt, they were types of Chriſt, which no King under heaven at this day is; Secondly, not the people only, but the very Land over which they ruled, were typicall alſo; the one of the ſpirituall Church of Chriſt, the other of the heavenly inheritance of that Church: both of them holy and conſecrate in ſpeciall manner unto God. If Kings and Magiſtrates under the Goſpel can plead either theſe reaſons, or any other of equall conſideration with theſe, I ſhall not ſcruple an acknowledgement of an equality of power in them. But otherwiſe, to alledge the power of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> in matters of Religion, for an inveſtiture of Kings and Magiſtrates under the Goſpel, with the like, juſtifies the arguing of the Prelaticall School, which pleads the order of the <hi>Aaronicall Prieſthood,</hi> to demonſtrate the neceſſity of a Metropoliticall ſoveraigntie.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It no where appears that any of the godly Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> ever <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>23</label> had, or exerciſed any power to ſuppreſs, baniſh, impriſon, trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cruſh or grinde the faces of any godly perſons among them, were they few or many, only becauſe they were for a while tender in point of conſcience to concurre with the major part of the Prieſts, Scribes,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:196793:33"/> or Levites in ſome things diſputable between them, and others in the Land. Vntill <hi>A. S.</hi> ſhall dig ſuch a treaſure as this out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hee will never have ſufficient wherewith to finiſh that tower of <hi>a Magiſtraticall coercive power in matters of Religion,</hi> which he hath begun to build.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If <hi>A. S.</hi> (or any other) will needs make the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>24</label> to his opinion, concerning that <hi>coercive power</hi> we ſpeak of in the Civill Magiſtrate, he muſt firſt prove, that theſe Kings were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with that power which they exerciſed in matters of Religion, by a morall Law, and which is of perpetuall obligation and ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon other Nations. For ſuch a weak man as I, will rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to think, that it was conferr'd upon them by a Law Politique and Judiciall; and which no more concerneth or obligeth Kings and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of other Nations, then that Law mentioned in the ſame place with it, (and which indeed is part of it) <hi>(Deut.</hi> 13.) which injoyneth <hi>the ſlaying of the Inhabitants of the</hi> Idolatrous <hi>City with the edge of the ſword, and the deſtroying of it utterly with all that is therein, and the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell thereof, with the edge of the ſword; and the gathering of all the ſpoil thereof into the midst of the ſtreet thereof, and the burning of the City with fire, and all the ſpoil thereof every whit; and the making it an heap for ever, and the not building it again.</hi> I think <hi>A. S.</hi> himſelf doth not conceive Chriſtian Kings or Magiſtrates ingag'd in conſcience to obſerve all the particulars in this Law.</p>
               <p n="8">8. (And laſtly) if you conſult with thoſe paſſages in the Law <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>25</label> where that power which the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> exerciſed about Idolatry and Idolaters, (for they went no further; they meddled not with the cruſhing of Sects or Schiſmes, as we heard) you will finde, that it was the generality or entire body of the Church or Nation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and not their Kings, that was inveſted with it by God: See <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. from the beginning to the end: and again, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 5. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 2, 3. with many of like conſideration. So that what they did in this kinde, they did it, or were to have done it, in the Name, and with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Body of their people.</p>
               <p>But the grand Pillar and ſupporter of this <hi>coercive power</hi> in Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, is this angry and diſcontented argument. What? Would you have all Religions, Sects and Schiſmes tolerated in Chriſtian churches? Should <hi>Jewes, Turks,</hi> (and <hi>Papiſts</hi> eſpecially,) be ſuffered in their Religions? What a confuſion muſt this needs breed, both in Church and State? Give me leave to demulce and pacifie this argument; and then we advance to a new ſubject. I anſwer by diſtinguiſhing.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:196793:34"/> 1. If by a <hi>toleration,</hi> the argument means either an approbation, or <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>26</label> ſuch a connivence which either takes no knowledge of, or however no ways oppoſeth ſuch Religions, Sects, or Schiſmes, as are unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, they are not to be tolerated. But firſt, orthodox and able Miniſters ought in the courſe of their publick Miniſtery, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon occaſion in a grave, ſober, and inoffenſive manner, ſoundly from the Scriptures to evince the folly, vanity, and falſhood of all ſuch wayes. Secondly, others alſo that have an anointing of light and knowledge from God, are bound to contribute occaſionally the beſt of their endevours towards the ſame end. Thirdly, in caſe the Miniſter ſhall be negligent, or forgetfull of his duty in this kind, the Magiſtrate may and ought from time to time to admoniſh him, that he fulfill his Miniſtery in that point alſo. Fourthly, if a perſon, one, two, or more, being members of a particular Church, ſhal be infected with any hereticall or dangerous opinion, and after two or three ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, with means of conviction uſed to regain him, ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue obſtinate, he ought to be caſt out from amongſt them by that Church. Fifthly and laſtly, if it be a whole Church that is ſo corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and infected, the reſt of the neighbour Churches, in caſe it hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ought to admoniſh it, and to endevour the reclaiming of it. If it be refractory after competent admonition, and meanes uſed for the reducing of it, they may and ought to renounce communion with it: and ſo ſet a mark or brand of hereſie and obſtinacie in the forehead of it. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, if by a toleration the argument means a non-ſuppreſſion <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>27</label> of ſuch Religions, Sects and Schiſmes by a ſtrong hand, as by fining, impriſoning, disfranchiſing, baniſhment, death, or the like; my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that they ought to be tolerated, onely upon this ſuppoſition, that the profeſſors or maintainers of them, be otherwiſe peaceable in the State, and every way ſubject to the Laws, and lawfull power of the civill Magiſtrate. My reaſons are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe God hath anointed and ſanctified his word, and the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>28</label> Miniſtery hereof, for the <hi>caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts it ſelfe againſt the knowledge of God, and for the bringing into captivity every thought unto the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 5. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in this place, <hi>v.</hi> 4. affirms, that the <hi>weapons of his warfare</hi> (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the knowledge which he had of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel, and his abilities of utterance and preaching) <hi>were mightie through God,</hi> for thoſe ends and purpoſes. When God hath appointed a means, and that of ſo much efficacy and power, either to prevent an
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:196793:34"/> inconvenience, or to accompliſh any end or effect whatſoever, for men to wave this means, and to intereſſe another of their own, is both to put an affront upon God, and to conſult fruſtration and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to themſelves. And for my part, I am all thoughts made, that the true and adequate reaſon why thoſe Sects and Schiſmes, and wild opinions which are lately ſtarted amongſt us, gather ſo much ſtrength and head, and grow ſo faſt upon us as they doe daily, is this; that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the wiſedome and counſell of God for the oppoſing and ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them, and have recourſe to our owne arm, hoping by diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, diſplacing, way-laying, impoveriſhing, ſuſpending, impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other weapons and ways of the fleſh, to eaſe our ſelves of the burthenſomneſſe and trouble of them. Beſides the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, there is a paſſage of full importance this way, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12, &amp;c. <hi>And he gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the worke of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, untill we all come into the unity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God,</hi> &amp;c. We ſee here that Gods deſigne and deſire, as well as ours, is <hi>unitie,</hi> and perfect agreement amongſt the Saints, in all matters of faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But how, or by what means, or by whom hath hee projected and purpoſed the obtaining of this his deſire? Mark, he doth not ſay, that he gave ſome Kings, and ſome Princes, and ſome Judges, and Juſtices of the Peace, ſome Purſevants, and ſome Jaylors, &amp;c. to bring us into the <hi>unitie</hi> of the faith; No, but <hi>he gave ſome Apoſtles, &amp; ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> to bring this deſirable end of his to paſſe. And if we would make more uſe of theſe agents and inſtruments of God, <hi>of the Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts,</hi> of <hi>Pastors and Teachers,</hi> and leſſe of thoſe other (which are our owne) for the quenching of thoſe flames of diviſions and diſſentions that are amongſt us in matters of Religion, we might in all likelihood ſee our deſires in this behalfe, many years ſooner then by any other courſe we are like to do. The word of God, eſpecially in the hand of an able Miniſter (among other ends) is given by God on purpoſe for the <hi>convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>ſtopping of the mouths of gain-ſayers,</hi> Tit. 1. 9, 11. And therfore this will doe it, when a thouſand other meanes, not having this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing oyle upon them, though never ſo plauſible, and promiſing in the eye of humane wiſedome, will rather open them yet wider, then otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the expreſſe order and command of God to Miniſters of the <label type="milestone">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth,</hi> being (as we ſee) a ſpeciall <hi>gift of God,</hi> and no man capable of it by his own induſtry or ſeeking, it is very unreaſonable that the want of it, being in it ſelfe a judgement upon a man from God, and withall no wayes prejudiciall or hurtfull unto others, (at leaſt not neceſſarily or unavoidably hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>30</label> unto any) ſhould expoſe him to further puniſhment and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from men. I conceive a reaſonable man will think it very hard and unreaſonable to puniſh a man for not doing of that, which is onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and in the power of God to doe.</p>
               <p>Externall compulſion in matters of Religion, is of a proper and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>31</label> direct tendencie to make men twofold more the children of ſin (and ſo of wrath) then they were before, or would be otherwiſe. Now that which directly tends to increaſe ſin and iniquity in a Land, cannot bee lawful, or from God. Suppoſe the State-Religion, and manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God, which the Magiſtrate practiſeth and profeſſeth, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the truth; yet if I, having no ſuch faith of either, but judging in my ſoule and conſcience, that both State and Magiſtrate, are polluted in both, ſhould make profeſſion of either as the truth, I ſhould be a notorious hypocrite and diſſembler before God and men, wounding my conſcience, and condemning my ſelfe in what I allow in this caſe. And yet ſuch a profeſſion as this, is that which the compulſive power of the Magiſtrate ſeekes to extort from me. In which caſe I muſt ſuffer, becauſe I will not ſin to the ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my ſoule.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, That the intent of the Magiſtrates compulſion in this caſe, is not to extort a profeſſion from me againſt my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſcience, but to ingage me to rectifie and reforme my
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:196793:35"/> judgment according to the truth, and ſo to make profeſſion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Firſt, that I ſtand already ingaged by a farre greater band hereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> my peace with God, and the ſafety of my ſoule, then ſuffering temporally from the Civill power. Nor can it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be here replied to me, that many will doe more for feare of a preſent temporall puniſhment, then of the future loſſe of their ſoules; becauſe they that will doe this, will be ready enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Magiſtrate in his Religion, what ever it be, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion. Secondly, if the intent of the temporall compulſion bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, be my engagement to rectifie my judgement according to the truth, &amp; then to profeſs accordingly, why is it diſcharged upon me before it be known whether I have not diſcharged ſuch my engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the uttermoſt of my power, and yet am not able to call that truth, which the Magiſtrate would have me ſo to call? <hi>Many</hi> (ſaith <note place="margin">Pro. 29. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomon) ſeek the face of the Ruler:</hi> and who would not gladly ſecond the Magiſtrate in his Religion, if he had his judgement and conſcience in his own hand or power?</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the civill Magiſtrate hath an actuall coercive power to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>32</label> Schiſmes, Hereſies, &amp;c. becauſe he is <hi>truly Chriſtian,</hi> which he had not before, then truth of Chriſtianity alters the property and tenour of Magiſtracie, and that for the worſe, in reſpect of thoſe that are in ſubjection to it; yea, and (poſſibly) in reſpect of the beſt of thoſe that are in ſuch ſubjection. Before he was <hi>truly Christian,</hi> he had (ſaith <hi>A. S.</hi> and Presbyterians generally) no power to puniſh, fine, impriſon, baniſh, cruſh any of his Subjects for the exerciſe of their conſcience towards God: but by vertue of that great mercy vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed unto him by God, in giving him part and fellowſhſhip with the Saints in Jeſus Chriſt, he is inveſted with a new power to perſecute the Saints, and to make them pay dearly for having conſciences better (it may be) then his own, at leaſt better then to comply outwardly with what they cannot inwardly digeſt and approve. If this be the caſe between a Chriſtian, and the Civill Magiſtrate under whom he lives, he hath ſmall incouragement to pray for the converſion of ſuch a Magiſtrate to the truth, in caſe he were for the preſent, Heterodox, or Pagan; it being farre better for him to live under ſuch a Magiſtracie, which hath no power to miſ-uſe him for his conſcience ſake, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that which hath; yea, and is made to beleeve, that it ought to uſe it accordingly.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That power is very dangerous for a Magiſtrate to own, in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:196793:36"/> exerciſe whereof, he may very eaſily (and commonly doth) run an hazard (at leaſt) <hi>of fighting againſt God,</hi> or of <hi>plucking up</hi> that which God hath <hi>planted,</hi> or of pulling down that which God hath built up. But is that power of ſuppreſſing Schiſmes, Hereſies, &amp;c. which <hi>A. S. Cum multis aliis,</hi> are very earneſt to faſten upon him. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition (I conceive) is too much every mans ſenſe and conſent, to be <hi>A. S.</hi> his diſſent. The Aſſumption I demonſtrate by this reaſon: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe practices and opinions in Religion, which the Magiſtrate is born in hand by thoſe, with whoſe eys hee ſees in ſuch caſes, are ſchiſmaticall, erroneous, and contrary unto God; may very poſſibly be the ways of God, and truths of God (ſuch mens judgements of them notwithſtanding.) For firſt, the judgements of theſe men are not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall, or infallible. <hi>A. S.</hi> himſelf, who makes his demands for Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian ſoveraignty, as high as another, yet dares not lay claim to this crown. Therefore it's poſſible for them to be in a miſpriſion about ſome Queſtion, or controverſall point in Religion. Secondly, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent experience ſhews, that a minor part (yea, a party for number in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable) of godly perſons in a Church or State, may have the minde of God and of Chriſt among them in ſome particulars, before the generality or major part of this Church, comes to be inlightened or intereſſed in it. For a proofe whereof <hi>ad hominem,</hi> we need go no further, then to that party of godly perſons in the Land, who ſtood up in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> &amp; King <hi>James</hi> his days, for Presbyteriall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when as the far greater part, both of Magiſtrates and Miniſters in the Kingdome, were in their judgements oppoſite hereunto, and wholly Epiſcopall. So that had that Queen or King, or any Parliament under them, gone about to ſuppreſs that party, which yet was then look'd upon as ſchiſmaticall, ſactious, and erroneous, they had (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>A. S.</hi> his judgement, touching the judgement of thoſe men) <hi>fought againſt God,</hi> and ſought to pluck up that which he hath planted. Yea, thirdly, (and laſtly) it ſeldome or never falls out, that any truth which hath for a long time been under hatches, and unknown to the generality of Miniſters and other learned men in a Church or State, hath been at the firſt, and on the ſudden, diſcovered by God, either unto the generality, or major part of them, but unto ſome few only, yea, and ſometimes but unto one (for a ſeaſon) by, and from whom, he is pleaſed to propagate the light and knowledge of it unto more afterwards. If then the Magiſtrate ſhould riſe up to ſuppreſs this truth, or thoſe that hold it forth unto the world, becauſe it hath few friends and many enemies amongſt the Maſters in his Iſrael, and is generally
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:196793:36"/> look'd upon as a ſchiſmaticall and erroneous opinion, ſhould he not (in <hi>Gamaliel's</hi> ſenſe) <hi>fight againſt God?</hi> The <hi>houſholder</hi> in the Parable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the <hi>plucking up of the Tares out of his field, for fear of plucking up the Wheat with them,</hi> Matth. 13. 29.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That power which was never attributed to the civill Magiſtrate, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>34</label> by any Chriſtians, but only by thoſe that had very good aſſurance that it ſhould be uſed for them, and on their ſide, is not like to be a power appertaining to them by divine right, or conferr'd upon them by God. The reaſon of this Propoſition is, becauſe it is no wayes credible, that within the compaſs of ſo many ages as are by-gone, no one man of that conſcientious generation of Saints, which hath been wont ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deny it ſelf even unto death, ſhould acknowledge ſuch a power in the civill Magiſtrate, as did by divine right belong unto him, only becauſe ſuch an acknowledgement was like to make againſt himſelf. Therefore I aſſume: But that <hi>coercive power in matters of Religion,</hi> for the ſuppreſſing of errours, ſchiſmes, hereſies, &amp;c. was never attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the civill Magiſtrate by any Chriſtian, but only by thoſe that <note place="margin">See for the further proof of the minor Propoſition, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Io. Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> Eſſayes, <hi>p.</hi> 49. 50, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> were very confident, that it would be uſed for their turns, and to effect their deſires. <hi>Ergo, A. S.</hi> himſelf is wary and tender above meaſure in conferring it upon him; diſtinguiſhing once and again, and the third time alſo upon it (as wee heard) before he dares let him have it; yea, and in the cloſe, doth as much (in effect) as tell him, that except hee be Presbyterian right down, and will accommodate him and his party with it, he ought not to claim it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That power which in the exerciſe of it, directly tends to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>35</label> hinder, or ſuppreſs the growth and increaſe of the light of the knowledge of God, and Jeſus Chriſt in a Church or State, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of ſuch things, whether in Doctrine or Diſcipline, as are unwarrantable therein, is not (queſtionleſs) of any Divine right or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. If <hi>A. S.</hi> deny this Propoſition, at the perill of his modeſty and reputation be it. So then I aſſume; But ſuch a power in the civill Magiſtrate as we ſpeak of, directly tends to all the miſchief and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience mentioned. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The evidence of the aſſumption is this: when men are obnoxious to the ſtroke of the civill power, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuffering deeply from the Magiſtrate, for any thing that they ſhall hold or practiſe in Religion contrary unto him, it muſt needs be a great tentation and diſcouragement upon them, from ſearching and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nquiring into the Scriptures, after a more exact knowledge of <hi>the good and holy, and perfect will of God</hi> in things; becauſe in caſe hee ſhould diſcover any thing contrary to what the Magiſtrate profeſſeth, hee
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:196793:37"/> muſt run the hazard, either of <hi>with-holding the truth</hi> hee ſo diſcovers, <hi>in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and ſo of having both God and his own conſcience his enemy, or elſe of having his bones broken by the iron rod of the civill Magiſtrate, for making profeſſion of any thing contrary to that which he profeſſeth.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That power which in the uſe of it plainly and palpably tends to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>36</label> the gratification of Satan, carnall and prophane men, is not (certainly) derived from God. To prove this Propoſition, would be but the lighting up of a torch to ſee the Sun. I aſſume; But that <hi>power in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion,</hi> to cruſh ſchiſmes, hereſies, &amp;c. which is by <hi>A. S.</hi> and many others, pinn'd upon the Magiſtrates ſleeve, is a power of this tendencie and importance in the uſe of it. <hi>Ergo.</hi> This latter Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhines clear enough with this light. Firſt, a very great part (if not far the greateſt) of thoſe that are like to ſuffer by it, are men of good conſcience, and truly fearing God. This is manifeſt in the Apologiſts and men of their judgement, whom <hi>A. S.</hi> himſelf, over and over (though condemning himſelf, <hi>toties quoties)</hi> acknowledgeth for very <hi>pious and godly men.</hi> Nor is it like that (ordinarily) men of looſe or no conſcience, ſhould delight to ſwim againſt the ſtreams, either of greatneſs or plurality, in matters of Religion. Now then it cannot but be conceived to be matter of ſolemn gratification to Satan, who is a murtherer, and blood<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> enemy to the Saints, to ſee them diſgraced, cruſhed, troden and trampled upon, eſpecially by thoſe, whom God hath appointed to be their protectours, and moſt of all, that this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous meaſure ſhould be meaſured out unto them for the goodneſs of their conſciences towards God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is the impatient and importune deſire of all ignorant, looſe, luke-warm and carnall profeſſors, to have all Religions, (as they call them) all wayes, ſects, opinions, and practices in Religion, wholly ſilenc'd, ſuppreſs'd, and aboliſhed where they live, excepting only that one way and practice, which ſhall be authoriſed and practiſed by the State. Becauſe by this means, they hope they ſhall not be diſtracted about their Religion, nor be put upon that ſore trouble of ſeeking it they know not where, or amongſt whom; but ſhall have it put into their mouths by the hand of Authority; which they hope likewiſe will ſtand between them and harm, in caſe it ſhould not prove a Religion of that purity and goodneſs, which God requireth.</p>
               <p n="10">10. (And laſtly) That power which in the uſe of it, directly tends <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>37</label> to defile and pollute the conſciences of men, either by deſtroying the ſoftneſs, tenderneſs, and ingenuity of them, or by diſturbing the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:196793:37"/> peace and comfort of them, or by both, is a power from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, not from above. (This Propoſition alſo, a conſcience any whit ingenuous, cannot lightly deny) But ſuch is the <hi>coercive power in matters of Religion,</hi> wherewith <hi>A. S.</hi> would fain befriend himſelf, in the civill Magiſtrate. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The truth of the Aſſumption appears in this conſideration: When the conſcience of a man hath once broke the bands and tie of its own light, and proſtituted it ſelf to the deſires and pleaſures of men, againſt the grain of its own judgement and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (whereunto it is ſorely tempted and urged, when the man is threatned deep, in caſe he ſhall not comply with the State in their Religion, his judgement and conſcience being wholly averſe to it) one of theſe two great evils or miſeries commonly befalls him. Either 1. God takes no more pleaſure in ſuch a conſcience afterwards, but withdrawing himſelf from it, leaves it unto it ſelf, whereupon ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as it were) reſenting the departure of God from it, it falls upon a courſe of hardening it ſelf, and by degrees contracts a boldneſs, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, and deſperateneſs in ſinning; as a woman by ſuffering a breach to be made upon her modeſtie or chaſtity once, often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes facile and prone to that kinde of ſinning afterwards; or elſe, 2. by reflecting upon what it hath done in ſuch a caſe, and feeding night and day upon the ſad thoughts of its own act, and caſting it up between God and it ſelf, how grievous a ſin it is, to trample upon its own light, for any mans ſake, or upon any conſideration whatſoever, it brings it ſelf into grievous agonies of perplexity, and horrour, out of which it never recovers afterward.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given <hi>A. S.</hi> an account of my preſent thoughts, touching that <hi>coercitive power in matters of Religion,</hi> which hee is ſo importune to put into the civill Magiſtrates hand, with both his own; making it as ſtrange and uncouth a matter, as a <hi>new Independencie</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts unto <hi>(pag.</hi> 60.) that any man ſhould not give the right hand of fellowſhip to his conceit herein. Which yet notwithſtanding I ſhall be moſt willing and ready to do, if the man will but do mee the courteſie ſolidly and theologue-like, by reaſon, and not by vote, that is, unanſwerably to anſwer the ten arguments propunded. For I profeſs ingenuouſly, there is nothing ſeparates between mee and his judgement in the point in hand, but only thoſe ten reaſons, with their fellows; and if I were able to anſwer them my ſelf, I would abate the condition required to the bargain, and purchaſe my agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him by mine own labour.</p>

               <p>He knows not which he had beſt fall upon, but hath a great minde to faſten upon both. When he hath occaſion to skirmiſh with the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts upon this point, me thinks I ſee him traverſing his ground, as if he trod upon hot Irons; he treads daintily and tenderly, and ſhifts his ſteppings to and again, off and on, as if he felt no ground under him, but that whereof he was jealous. And it ſeems, that for the whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it ſelf of perſons ingaged in <hi>A. S.</hi> his judgement about Church-government, though they be but one, reſolutely enough agreed for the government it ſelf; yet there are great diviſions of heart amongſt them concerning the parentage and deſcent of it. Some out of a deſire to have it the more adored and reverenced in the world, will needs have it to be of the houſe and lineage of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme, <hi>viz.</hi> from heaven, from the Scriptures; Others of them, fearing that genealogie to be ſo perplexed and intricate, that it is fitter to make ſtrife and queſtions of, then demonſtration and ſatisfaction, think it better to wave that title, and claim, and to content themſelves with a Meropean, in ſtead of a Phoebean parentage for it; to riſe no higher then the liberty or power of the Church it ſelf, to ſeek its originall. Which cleft in the houſe conſidered, it was a very prudent ſpoke put into the wheel of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts, by him that gave counſell (if all tales be true) at no hand to have it put to vote, whether Presbyteriall Government could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Scriptures, or no. Such a vote as this might very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have prov'd of as interruptory a conſequence to the builders of this Government, as the confuſion of tongues ſometimes did to buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of another fabrick.</p>

               <p>By the way, the ingenuous diſſent of that party amongſt you, who cannot ſay that they ſee any lineament of Heaven in the face of your Government, being yet wel-willers, and friends of affections large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough unto it, is unto me as little leſſe then a demonſtration as may be, that your way is but from men, and not from God. For as the ſaying is, <hi>Quid non ſentit amor?</hi> If there were any thing in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that did but look merrily, or caſt a plauſible glance upon your way, would not they that are ſo entirely devoted both in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and affections to it, find it out? yea and double and treble the ſympathy and ſtrength of it with their imaginations? As it is the propertie of Love, to <hi>cover a multitude of ſinnes</hi> or treſpaſſes, that are, <hi>(Prov.</hi> 10. 12.) ſo is it a property likewiſe of the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to diſcover a multitude of pleaſing accommodations which are not.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is ſomewhat more then a mote in the eye of your unitie, that <hi>in ſome Churches</hi> (of your Presbyteriall calculation) <hi>particular or Parochial Senats or Conſiſtories, have power to ſuſpend from their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thoſe that be members thereof; yea alſo to excommunicate them, &amp;c.</hi> This is your own bounteous acknowledgment, <hi>p.</hi> 26.

For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, was the <hi>adaequate end</hi> of the government of that Church, the <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>externall peace</hi> of the Church? Had it nothing in deſigne, for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good, for the edification of the members of it in knowledge, faith, and holineſſe? Was the power of the high Prieſt given him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keep the Church in externall peace? I thought that to provide for the externall peace of the Church, had rather appertained to the civill Magiſtrate and government, then to the Eccleſiaſtick; and it is the Apoſtle himſelfe that thus thoughteth me, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. where he enjoyneth; that <hi>ſupplications, prayers,</hi> &amp;c. be made <hi>for Kings and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and honeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, neither doe I find in the practiſe of that Church, any power given to the combined rulers and governours thereof, for the creation, ſuſpenſion, depoſition of Church-officers. I read of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a Church-officer (and no mean one neither) by the Civill Magiſtrate, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 2. 27. <hi>So Solomon caſt out Abiathar from being Prieſt unto the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> but of any ſuch depoſition by the combined ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of that Church, I remember not that I have read. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for any power of <hi>determining matters of Doctrine,</hi> this is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> out of my ken in the <hi>practice of that Church,</hi> then any thing elſe. I know not well what <hi>A. S.</hi> means by his phraſe of <hi>Determining mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Doctrine;</hi> but in my notion, and in the Grammaticall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe of the word, <hi>Determine,</hi> the claim of ſuch a power riſeth up as a high partition-wall between me and his Government. If by a <hi>power of determining matters of doctrine,</hi> he meanes nothing elſe but a liberty or ability of diſcuſſing and arguing ſuch matters, and of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the iſſues and reſults of ſuch diſcuſſions, unto the Churches, as conſonant (in their judgements) to the truth, with a propoſall of their deſires unto the Churches, to conſider well of them, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:196793:40"/> them, if they can ſo judge and conceive of them, I have nothing to oppoſe againſt this power. But if by his <hi>power to determine matters of Religion,</hi> he means a power of concluding or defining, what men ſhall be bound in conſcience to receive and beleeve for truth, and ſhal be look'd upon as ſinning, in caſe they doe it not, whether they ſee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for what is ſo concluded, and obtruded upon them, or not, (which I partly beleeve to be <hi>A. S.</hi> his ſenſe, I am ſure is the proper ſenſe of the word) ſuch a power is, (and I think ever will bee) the firſt-born of the abhorrings of my ſoul. I confeſſe I cannot be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confident that <hi>A. S.</hi> intends the reſidence of ſuch a power as this, in his Presbyterian Aſſemblies; partly, becauſe he ſpeakes ſomewhat like a man in this behalfe elſewhere, ſuppoſing it to be <hi>ſafe even for a few men to diſſent from all the world,</hi> in caſe they have <hi>very ſtrong reaſons for their</hi>

                  <hi>diſſent,</hi> pag. 22. and requires no ſubjection in <hi>particular Congregations unto the judgment of Senats or Aſſemblies, but according to Gods word, pag.</hi> 28. (I truſt he means, ſo apprehended by the congregation; without this there is no ſubjection according to Gods word.) And again, pag. 68. acknowledgeth it as <hi>an undoubted maxime, that the church hath no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power in her judgments,</hi> &amp;c. with many ſavoury expreſſions in this kind; partly alſo, becauſe I find this indulgence generally ſubſcribed with Presbyterian pens, <hi>That the authority which Claſſes and Synods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, is not abſolute, nor their Decrees held to be infallible, but to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the word of God, and not to be received further then they do agree here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</hi> And yet on the other hand I confeſſe, that I cannot conceive, or comprehend how <hi>A. S.</hi> his government can hold up her head like her ſelfe, if this Iron-mace be taken out of her hand. For my part, if this one Article of a liberty to wave Presbyteriall Injunctions and Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in caſe of a <hi>non liquet</hi> from the word of God, to him, to whom they are tendered, will bee but aſſented unto, and candidly kept and performed, it would be the beſt Mediator I know to reconcile my thoughts and judgement to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor can I in the practice of the Jewiſh Church, find either <hi>vola</hi> or <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>veſtigium</hi> of a <hi>power</hi> granted unto the Rulers thereof, to make Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall laws <hi>concerning things indifferent;</hi> I rather find a prohibition ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon them for making any ſuch laws; <hi>Ye ſhall put nothing unto the word which I command you, nor ſhall you take ought therefrom, &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 4. 2. So again, Chap. 12. 32. If <hi>A.

               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:196793:41"/> 5. And laſtly, in the practice of the Jewiſh Church, the Prelaticall <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> Schoole ſees a viſion or platforme of her government alſo. And <hi>A. S.</hi> by your leave, the High-Prieſt as well in his Authoritie as in his robes and holy accoutrements, did farre more plauſibly ſympathize with Metropoliticall ſtate and greatneſſe, then with Presbyteriall. For my part, I am not able to diſcern in all the practice of the Jewiſh Church, from the one end of it unto the other, any peece, ſtraine, or veine of ſuch a <hi>patterne</hi> as <hi>A. S.</hi> ſpeaks of. Surely the viſion is ſo condition'd, as not to be ſeen but upon Presbyterian ground. The man did wiſely in granting that he had <hi>no formall or expreſſe patterne</hi> for his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either <hi>from the Old</hi> or <hi>New Teſtament:</hi> but he ſhould have done more ingenuouſly to have added, <hi>no nor yet any materiall</hi> or <hi>implicit patterne neither.</hi> For if he hath any <hi>materiall patterne,</hi> it is ſo purely <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall,</hi> that it may contend with <hi>materia prima</hi> it ſelfe for the prize of Inviſibilitie. If he hath any <hi>implicit,</hi> it is wrapt up under ſo many folds and pleights of obſcurity, that no ſeeing eye is able to pierce through to it.</p>
               <p>But doe we not give ſentence too ſoon? It may be his <hi>pattern from the New Teſtament</hi> will carry it, though that from the Old refus'd to meddle with it. But where ſhall we ſeek this? He tells us, pag. 41. <hi>That we may ſee it in the Hiſtory of the New Teſtament, in the judgement given out at the Synod</hi> (either truly or untruly ſo called) of <hi>Hieruſalem, concerning the buſineſſe of Antiochia.</hi> What poſſibly <hi>we may ſee</hi> in length and time, is not eaſie to determine for the preſent; but I have both more hope and feare of ſeeing a thouſand other things (which yet I cannot certainly ſay, that I ſhall ſee) then I have of either, ever to ſee Claſſicall proceedings demonſtrated out of that paſſage of Scripture. Nor doth <hi>A. S.</hi> ſo much as put forth his little finger towards ſuch a Demonſtration, but contents himſelfe (for the preſent) to threaten us with his own <hi>hope,</hi> of <hi>ſeeing</hi> the buſines <hi>clearly demonstrated to us by a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hand ere long. Clear demonſtrations</hi> of any thing from the Scriptures, ſhall be very welcome to us at any time; but me thinks I ſee ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable difficulties in the way, that I feare that <hi>Demonſtration</hi> will never come out cleare. Yet becauſe I would help forward the <hi>clearnes</hi> of it what I can, I ſhal make bold to propound unto him that either is, or ſhall be the undertaker thereof, a few particulars, which (I humbly conceive) muſt be ſubſtantially prov'd to make the <hi>Demonstration clear,</hi> at leaſt to me, and many others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be prov'd, that the Apoſtles in that meeting at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 6. ſate there onely in the capacitie of ordinary Elders,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:196793:41"/> or Presbyters, and not as Apoſtles. <hi>i.</hi> that they wav'd or ſilenc'd the ſpirit of infallibilitie which was given them, and fell to worke with the weak and fallible ſpirits of other men; which is, as if a man ſhould pull out his eyes to ſee with the holes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt further be prov'd, that this Councell at Ieruſalem had their ſtate and ſet times of meeting, as weekly, monthly, yearly, or the like, and that they did not aſſemble occaſionally onely. For this is one of the high characters of Presbytery by <hi>A. S.</hi> his owne calculation, pag. 39.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It muſt yet be prov'd, that they had <hi>Authoritatem citationis,</hi> an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative power to cite and call before them whom they pleaſed within the pale of Apoſtolicall juriſdiction, that is, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the whole world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It muſt alſo be made cleere, that the Apoſtles and Elders that were members of this Synod, were ſent hereunto, by thoſe particular Churches, over whom they had right to claime Juriſdiction, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to include in their determinations.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Demonſtration</hi> will never bee <hi>cleare,</hi> till it be ſubſtantially prov'd, that there was none authorized to ſit in that Councell, but onely Church-Officers and Eccleſiaſticall men; the contrary hereof ſeeming (at leaſt) very apparent, from <hi>ver.</hi> 22. &amp; 23.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That like wiſe muſt not be left unprov'd, that this Councell had power, as well to make new Laws of indifferent things, as to impoſe things neceſſary upon the Churches. <hi>ver.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Demonſtrator to make his worke <hi>cleere</hi> and clever, muſt prove that the Churches of Syria and Cilicia, had their Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or Delegates, fitting authoritatively in this Synod, becauſe they are included in the Determination, <hi>ver.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It muſt be prov'd likewiſe, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſate as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners upon the ſame terms for the Church of Antioch in this Synod.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It muſt be made to appeare, either that this Synod or Councell would have proceeded as now they did, whether they could have ſaid, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us,</hi> or no, or that ordinary Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods or Aſſemblies may lawfully proceed as they did, though they have no ſuch aſſurance of a concurrence of the Holy Ghoſt with them, as they had.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And laſtly, Proofe muſt be made, that thoſe words in the cloſe of the Epiſtle (ſent from this Councell to the reſpective Churches)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:196793:42"/> 
                  <hi>yee ſhall do well,</hi> ver. 29. are fulminative, &amp; import ſome ſuch threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or intimation as this, that if they did not ſubmit, ſome further courſe muſt be taken with them.</p>
               <p>If all theſe particulars ſhall be ſubſtantially cleered and proved, I ſhall freely acknowledge that there is a plauſible <hi>patterne</hi> for <hi>A. S.</hi> his Government, in the new Teſtament, but <hi>Hic labor, hoc opus eſt.</hi> I ſhall not pre-judge any mans abilities; but for the preſent, I doe as much expect the fulfilling of that Poeticall Prophecie,</p>
               <q>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nda dabit flammas, &amp; dabit ignis aquas,</q>
               <p>as I doe ever to ſee that fifteenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> ſafely deliver'd of the man-child cal'd <hi>Presbyterie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>A. S.</hi> muſt pardon us if as yet wee be not able to ſee any patterne at all of his Government, neither <hi>formall,</hi> nor <hi>materiall,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>explicit,</hi> nor <hi>implicit,</hi> either in the old or new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Well, but yet the man hath one ſtring to his bowe more; though <hi>Grace</hi> wil not relieve him, it may be <hi>nature</hi> will. He hath (as hee ſaith) <hi>a patterne in the Law of Nature which will ſuffice.</hi> They muſt (I beleeve) have verie good appetites to Presbyterie, that will bee ſuffic'd with this pattern. The Law of nature is a very vaſt volume, and <hi>A. S.</hi> hath not quoted either page, leaf, or ſection of the book, ſo that I know not whither to turne, or where to look for his patterne. But me thinks the man himſelfe hath given ample teſtimonie to the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> that it is no ways guiltie of, or acceſſarie to his Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For that which cannot be made out, to the judgements and conſciences of men, without the helpe of ſuch an hoſt of ſcholaſtique, intricate, (if not inexplicable) diſtinctions, as <hi>A. S.</hi> is fain to leavie, and muſter together, <hi>p.</hi> 29. 30. 31. 32. &amp;c. before he can make either head or foot of his buſineſſe, what other originall or deſcent ſoever it may claim, I know not, but (queſtionleſſe) <hi>the Law of Nature</hi> will not owne. The Law of nature ſaith with one of natures ſons; <hi>Odi difficiles nugas:</hi> ſhe meddles not with ſubtilties, niceties, or curioſities of diſtinctions. A man that is unlearned, and but of ordinarie capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that ſhall read the pages laſt quoted, may very poſſibly take his odde and uncouth diſtinctions for names of unclean ſpirits, and thinke that the man conjur's for his Government.</p>
               <p>But will you pleaſe to heare the names of his beagles, with which he follows his game, and hunts claſſique Law out of thoſe deep and dark caverns &amp; tullians of the earth where Nature had hid it, <hi>ſtygiiſ<expan>

                  </gap>s corner-ſtone is given us by our Adverſaries, that <hi>where there is no neighbourhood of Congregations, or ſingle Churches, whereby they may with conveniency be aiding each to other, there a ſingle Congregation muſt not be denyed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntireneſs of juriſdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If wee cannot upon this advantage of ground, make good this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment againſt all oppoſition, it is very ill beſtowed on us, and wee deſerve to be puniſhed with that, which lifts up it ſelf againſt it. But,</p>
               <p>Firſt, if <hi>entireneſs</hi> of Government or <hi>juriſdiction</hi> be not to be <hi>denyed to a ſingle Congregation,</hi> when it is ſolitary, and without neighbours, then certainly it hath a lawfull right, title, or claim to ſuch a Juriſdiction. For whatſoever doth not in a way of equity or right belong unto any man, ought to be denyed unto him. If then a ſingle Church in this caſe, hath a right to an intireneſs of rule and government within it ſelf, I would gladly know, by what right any other Church or churches, be they never ſo many, can take away this right or priviledge from it. <hi>Thoſe whom God hath put together</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, in the caſe of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage) <hi>let not man put aſunder.</hi> Doubtleſs, if a ſingle Church, under the circumſtance mentioned, hath a <hi>right to an intireneſs of juriſdiction within it ſelf,</hi> it hath this right conferred upon it by God, or Chriſt himſelf, there being no other fountain or foundation thereof imaginable. And if ſo, then who ever ſhall take away, or deny this right of Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto it, muſt ſhew a commiſſion from heaven to do it, or otherwiſe be guilty of <hi>putting thoſe a ſunder whom God hath joyned together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if a Church yet ſingle, be inveſted with a power of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction within it ſelf, and ſhould be caſhiered of this power, by the riſing up of more Churches neer unto her, then that which is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God as a table, ſhould become a ſnare unto her; ſhe ſhould ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſs, and have ſorrow from thoſe, by whom ſhee ought to be comforted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If a ſingle Church ſhould ſuffer loſs of ſo conſiderable a priviledge, as entireneſs of Juriſdiction is, by the multiplication of Churches neer unto her, then cannot this Church pray for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpel in places neer to it, but ſhe muſt pray againſt her
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:196793:43"/> own comfort and peace; which is a ſore temptation upon her, either to pray very faintly, or not to pray at all, for ſuch a thing.</p>
               <p>If it be objected and ſaid, that intireneſs of Juriſdiction is no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or priviledge to a ſingle Church, but rather an inconvenience, or a diminutive priviledge at beſt, and that her condition ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, not impaired, by combining her ſelf in point of government with other Churches: I anſwer,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the Scripture it ſelf makes intireneſs of government, or ſubjection only unto thoſe that are of the ſame ſociety or body, a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall mercy, favour, and bleſſing from God. <hi>And their Nobles ſhall be of themſelves</hi> (ſaith God, ſpeaking of that great goodneſs he meant to ſhew unto his people after their return from Babylon) <hi>and their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour ſhall proceed from the midst of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 30. 21. So it is made a character or ſign of the proſperous eſtate of <hi>Tyres,</hi> that <hi>her wiſe men that were in her, (i.</hi> of her own Nation) <hi>were her pilots,</hi> Ezek. 27. 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſubjection unto ſtrangers, is ſtill ſpoken of as matter of puniſhment and ſorrow: <hi>Give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen ſhould reigne over it,</hi> Joel 2. 17. The Nations of the Jews were expreſly forbidden to <hi>ſet ſtrangers to rule over them,</hi> Deut. 17. 15.</p>
               <p>If it be objected; But Paſtours or Elders of neighbour Churches ought not to be looked upon as ſtrangers, but as Brethren: I anſwer, (in a word) though they be brethren in compariſon of the unbelieving party of the world, and in reſpect of their ſpirituall deſcent from the ſame Father with them; yet have they more of the relation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ſtrangers to them, then thoſe that are (as it were) of the ſame domeſtique ſociety with them. And therefore ſubjection to them, muſt needs have leſs of the bleſſing, and more of the curſe in it, then ſubjection to their own.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the grant of Government and Rule within themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Towns and Corporations, were ever eſteemed matters of ſpeciall grace and favour from Princes: and have ſometimes been purchaſed with great ſummes by the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, reaſon it ſelf demonſtrates intireneſs of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to be a ſweet priviledge and benefit to a particular Church. Firſt, in caſe a man be queſtioned, he ſaves a proportion both of time, and labour of travell in reſpect of whath muſt undergo, if hee were to make his anſwer at a Conſiſtory further off. Secondly, proceedings againſt him in his own ſociety ſhall be regulated, managed and ordered by his owne Paſtour, who is a Father unto him in the Lord, and who in all reaſon, and according to the courſe of (al moſt) all conſtant expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:196793:44"/> is more tender, affectionate, and compaſſionate towards him, then the Paſtors of other flocks, and thoſe that are ſtrangers to him. The <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that knew <hi>Joſeph,</hi> dealt well by him, his kindred, and ſeed: but (ſaith the Text) <hi>There aroſe another Pharaoh that knew not Joſeph, and he evill intreated our Fathers, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, he ſhall be tried, and ſentenced by thoſe, who know not how ſoon it may be their own caſe to be tried and ſentenced by him again; which in reaſon cannot but teach them moderation and equity, in whatſoever they ſhall act or ſuggeſt againſt him; whereas, a Conſiſtory of ſtanding Judges, whoſe <hi>fair necks</hi> have little or no cauſe to fear any <hi>yoke</hi> of being judged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are in far more danger, through a confident and conſtant uſe of the Scepter, of having their hand hardened, and their little finger ſoon made as heavie as their loins. It is a good rule which <hi>A. S.</hi> himſelf prompteth us withall in this caſe, pag. 10. <hi>Nunquam ſatis fida potentia, ubi nimia eſt;</hi> power ſeldom yeelds any good fruit, where it is too rank and luxuriant. Fourthly, it is a great incouragement and confirmation of face, to a man that is accuſed, and is call'd to anſwer for himſelfe, eſpecially, if he be any thing tender foreheaded and baſhfull, as many of inferiour breed and education are, to anſwer before thoſe, whoſe faces are familiar to him, and with whoſe perſons he is well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the contrary is a kind of oppreſſion to ſuch a man. Such an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage or diſadvantage as this, may eaſily amount to as much, as either a mans ſtanding, or falling in this cauſe. A Conſiſtory of ſtrange faces, eſpecially the perſons being all of ſuperiour rank and quality to him, may be to a plain man, of as bad a conſequence, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the ſeeing of <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s head was (among the Poets) it may turn him into a ſtone, and make him able to ſay little for himſelf; whereas, if he be to make anſwer at home, the knowledge and intereſt hee hath, of, and in thoſe perſons before whom he is to ſpeak, will be a ſoveraign antidote unto him againſt ſuch fears, as otherwiſe might betray him in his cauſe. Fifthly, in this Government we ſpeak of, by the Congregation, private Chriſtians have the opportunity of ſeeing and hearing from time to time, all the carriages, debates, and judiciary proceedings in the Church, which will be not only matter of much ſatisfaction, but alſo as a ſchool of wiſdom and experience unto them daily; whereas, if theſe tranſactions be negotiated at a remote Conſiſtory, the private Chriſtian loſeth his portion and intereſt in them. Sixthly (and laſtly) Concluſions many times are very offenſive and hard to be digeſted, for want of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the premiſſes, that ſhould allay and ſweeten them. Claſſique determinations and awards, eſpecially when they riſe high, the reaſons
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:196793:44"/> and grounds of them being (for the moſt part) unknown to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men, and of hard conſtruction with them: whereas the iſſues and awards that are brought forth in a Congregation, the whole ſeries and ſtorie of all proceedings, <hi>à capite ad calcem,</hi> being known unto all, muſt needs be much more ſatisfactory, and of a far better reſentment with men. Theſe reaſons might have been inlarged with much more ſtrength and weight, and many others likewiſe added to them; but for the preſent, deſirous wee are that brevity ſhould have the caſting voyce.</p>
               <p>Who then can lay any thing to the charge of this Government? That can I (quoth <hi>A. S.</hi> in effect, <hi>p.</hi> 38, 39.) I have ſixteen reaſons or objections againſt it. Yea, but <hi>A. S.</hi> your ſixteen Reaſons (or at leaſt the greateſt part of them, as far as I can ſee) have all but one head; and if that be ſtruck off, all thoſe reaſons are but as ſo many dead <hi>corpſes.</hi> You alledge againſt the Apologiſts, that the <hi>remedy</hi> in their way of Government, for the reducing of whole Congregations or Churches, in caſe they miſcarry or be irregular, <hi>is not ſufficient nor ſatisfactory.</hi> This you prove by laying pen upon paper, untill you had ſixteen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (ſo called) in black and white. I ſhall not ſpend time in tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing theſe your Reaſons, but ſhall deſire the Reader (though it may be ſome diſcourteſie unto you) to take your book into his hand, and to conſider of them with what is repon'd in Anſwer to them.</p>
               <p>And firſt, for that defectiveneſs you charge upon the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Government, for the reduction of whole Churches, under er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, miſcarriages, &amp;c. I anſwer:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Suppoſe that courſe or means which the Apologiſts inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>a with-drawing, and renouncing all Chriſtian communion with ſuch Churches, untill they repent,</hi> be not in the eye of reaſon or humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture a means <hi>ſufficient</hi> for ſuch a purpoſe, and that not only ſixteen, but ſix and twenty reaſons, and thoſe more plauſible then <hi>A. S.</hi> his ſixteen, could be levied againſt it, yet if it be a means which God hath authorized for the effecting it (as I verily believe it is, neither doth <hi>A. S.</hi> nor any of his, that yet I have met with, prove the contrary) it will do the deed, and proſper, when as ſeven other means that are greater of fleſh, and more promiſing, will but beat the air, and do little of what was intended and projected to have been done by them. How many reaſons may we probably conceive, that the <hi>diſputers of this world in Paul's</hi> time, were able to bandie againſt preaching, whereby to prove it fooliſhneſs? yet this was, and ſtill is, and ever will be, maugre all the oppoſition of ten thouſand diſputations and reaſons
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:196793:45"/> againſt it, <hi>the wiſdome of God, and the power of God, to ſave thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> The ſtrength and power of ſacred Ordinances do not lie in their natures, but in their relations or inſtitutions. Now, that a <hi>with-drawing of Chriſtian communion</hi> from perſons walking inordinately, is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or means appointed by God, for the reducing and reclaiming of them, is evident, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 6. with the 14. <hi>We warn you Brethren, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that yee withdraw your ſelves from every brother that walketh inordinately,</hi> &amp;c. and verſ. 14. <hi>If any man obey not this our ſaying in this letter note him, and have no company with him, that he may be aſhamed.</hi> Clearly implying, that to with-draw communion, and to deny Chriſtian fellowſhip unto Chriſtians walking inordinately, is both a means of Divine inſtitution, and otherwiſe proper and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious in it ſelf, to reclaim and bring them to Repentance. There is the ſame reaſon of Churches in this behalf, which there is of perſons; Churches being nothing elſe but perſons embodied.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe there were no ſuch <hi>ſufficient or ſatisfactory remedy</hi> for the inconvenience mentioned in the way of the Apologiſts, as <hi>A. S.</hi> conceives to be in his (which yet there is, as hath in part already, and will afterwards further appear) yet Lawyers have a ſaying, that <hi>a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is better then an inconvenience.</hi> A man had better run the hazard of a greater loſs, then expoſe himſelf to a daily waſting and conſuming of his eſtate. A man had better be wet through and through with a ſoaking ſhowre once a yeer, then be expoſed in his houſe to <hi>continuall droppings</hi> all the yeer long. The Delinquencie of whole Churches, (ſuch I mean, as is matter of publique ſcandall or offence to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches) is not an every dayes caſe, no more in the way of <hi>Congregationall</hi> then of <hi>Presbyteriall</hi> Government: you acknowledge the rarity of it in your Government, and we affirm it in ours. Now then much better it is, to want a remedy againſt ſuch an evill, which poſſibly may not fall out within an age, though it be greater when it doth fall, then it is to expoſe our ſelves <hi>to continuall droppings,</hi> I mean, to thoſe daily inconveniences which wee lately ſhewed to be incident to the Claſſique Government.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they that implead the Congregationall way, for being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, as touching the matter in hand, ſeem to ſuppoſe, that God hath put a ſufficiency of power into the hands of men, to remedy all defects, errours, and miſcarriages of men whatſoever. Elſe why ſhould it be made matter of ſo deep a charge and challenge againſt the way of the Apologiſts, that it affords not a <hi>ſufficient and ſatisfactory remedy</hi> either to prevent or heal all poſſible miſcarriages in all churches?
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:196793:45"/> I would willingly know, in caſe your <hi>Church tranſcendent,</hi> your ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Seſſion of Presbyters, ſhould miſcarry, and in your Doctrinall determinations, give us <hi>hay, ſtubble, and wood,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>ſilver, gold,</hi> and <hi>precious ſtones,</hi> (a miſpriſion, you know, wel-neer as incident to ſuch Aſſemblies, yea, and to thoſe that are more generall and oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all then ſo, as obſtinacy in errour is to particular Congregations) what remedy the poor Saints and Churches of God under you have, or can expect againſt ſuch a miſchiefe; or what remedy you now have in the way of your government, for the recovering of your ſelves out of ſuch a ſnare, more then what the Congregationall way affordeth, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of particular Churches. Nay, the truth is, your Government in ſuch a caſe is at a greater loſs in reſpect of any propable or hopefull remedy againſt ſuch an evill (which yet is an evill of a moſt dangerous conſequence) then the other way of Government is for the reduction of particular Churches. That hath the <hi>remedy</hi> of God (as hath been ſhewed) though not the <hi>remedy</hi> of men, and yet that <hi>remedy</hi> of God which it hath, is appliable by men, and thoſe known who they are, <hi>viz.</hi> the Churches of Chriſt neer adjoyning; but if your great Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtique body be tainted or infected, though never ſo dangerouſly, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Corpora mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis majora patent.</hi> Sen.</note> God muſt have <hi>mercy on you,</hi> and that in a way ſomewhat (at leaſt) more then ordinary, if ever you be healed. For that <hi>Directive power in matters of Religion,</hi> which, had you left it in other mens hands, might in this caſe, through the bleſſing of God, have healed you, being now only in your own, hath not only occaſioned that evill diſeaſe that is upon you, but alſo leaves you helpleſs and cureleſs by other men. <hi>A. S.</hi> makes the greateſt part of his arguments againſt that way of Government which hee oppoſeth, of <hi>what iffs,</hi> I mean, of looſe and impertinent ſuppoſitions, and caſes, that are not like to fall out, till <hi>urſa major,</hi> and <hi>urſa minor</hi> meet (unto which kind of arguments, every whit as much as enough hath been anſwered already) but he ſhall ſhew himſelf a ſoveraign Benefactour indeed to the Presbyterian cauſe, if he can find out <hi>a remedy ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſufficient</hi> againſt that ſore evill we ſpeak of incident to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the caſe mentioned: which is a caſe both of a far worſe conſequence then the obſtinacy of a particular Church in ſome error; and (I fear) of a far more frequent occurrence then the world is willing to take notice of.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let us ponder a little, how <hi>ſufficient and ſatisfactorie</hi> that <hi>remedie</hi> againſt the evill now in conſideration, is, which the Claſſique politie, under the protection of A. S. his pen, ſo much glorieth in; let
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:196793:46"/> us compare the two remedies, of the two corriving polities together, as A. S. hath done, after this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Presbyteriall Government</hi> (ſaith he, p. 39.) <hi>is ſubject to none of theſe inconveniences: For the collective or combined elderſhip having an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative power, all men and Churches thereof are bound by Law and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to ſubmit themſelves thereunto: Every man knoweth their ſet times of meeting, wherein ſundrie matters are diſpatched, and all things carried by pluralitie of voyces, without any ſchiſme or ſeparation.</hi> Not to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the man about his Grammaticals, (wherein his pen ſlips oftner then <hi>Priſcian</hi> will <hi>tolerate</hi> in ſuch a piece) becauſe in theſe he oppoſeth nothing but a mans conceit either of overmuch ſcholarſhip, or overmuch care, in him.</p>
               <p>Here is a <hi>remedie</hi> indeed againſt ſome inconveniences; but whether the inconveniences be not much better then the remedie, <hi>adhuc ſub Judice lis eſt.</hi> But what are the inconveniences?</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>that Churches being equall in authoritie, one cannot binde another to give any account, in caſe of offence given.</hi> Well, what is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for this in Claſſique conſtitution? <hi>The combined Elderſhip having an authoritative power, all men and Churches thereof are bound by Law and Covenant to ſubmit themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. What is another inconvenience? <hi>In caſe other churches were offended in the proceedings of a particular church, they could not judge in it; for then they ſhould be both judge and partie in one cauſe, &amp;c.</hi> Well, what is the remedie in Presbyterian politie? <hi>The combined Elderſhip having an authoritative power, all men and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp;c.</hi> What is a third inconvenience? <hi>That Congregationall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giveth no more power or authoritie to a thouſand Churches over one, then to a Tinker, yea to the Hangman over a thouſand, &amp;c.</hi> What is the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian remedie for this? <hi>The combined Elderſhip having an Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>combined Elderſhip</hi> with their <hi>Authoritative power</hi> together <hi>with a Law or Covenant whereby all men and Churches under them, are bound to ſubmit unto them,</hi> are as bars of iron and gates of braſſe to keep out al thoſe inconveniences, irregularities, defilements, pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, out of the Presbyterian Temple, whereunto (it ſeems) the Congregationall temple, for want of ſuch ſtoure and tight proviſions, lies open. But,</p>
               <p>Firſt, what if your <hi>combined Elderſhip</hi> hath neither footing nor foundation in the Word of God? It is not the ſerviceableneſſe of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a thouſand ſuch inconveniences as were mentioned, that will juſtifie it. <hi>Souls</hi> offering ſacrifice was a means to prevent the <hi>ſcattering of the people</hi> from him; yet <hi>Samuel</hi> told him that <hi>he had done fooliſhly in</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:196793:46"/> 
                  <hi>it;</hi> and it coſt him his Kingdom. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 9. 13. 14. So the putting forth of <hi>Vzz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h's</hi> hand to ſtay the Ark, was a meanes to keepe it from being ſhaken; but yet the doing of it coſt him his life. <hi>Peters</hi> valour and zeale in drawing his ſword, and laying about him, was a likely meanes of reſcuing his Maſter; but the Lord Chriſt preferred the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger of his life before ſuch a reſcue, and check'd the ſword that was drawne for him againe into the ſheath. That Law and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in the Papacie, whereby <hi>all men &amp; all Churches thereof,</hi> are bound to ſubmit their judgements in matters of Faith to the deciſion of the Papall Chair, is as ſoveraigne a <hi>remedie</hi> againſt all thoſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces named, as that for which Claſſique Authoritie is ſo much magnified by you; and yet it is never the leſſe abominable in the eyes both of God and men. The Queſtion is not, which Government will ſerve moſt turnes; but which is moſt agreeable to the will and Word of God. If that of Presbyterie be defective this way, as there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame cauſe to feare it is, this defect cannot be recompenced or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by any other commendation whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, neither can we with any tolerable ſatisfaction informe our ſelves out of all your diſcourſe, either what you meane by that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative power,</hi> which you claime to your <hi>combined Elderſhip,</hi> nor yet how, or by what, or whoſe Authoritie, they come to be inveſted with it. As for the power, ſometimes you deny it to be <hi>Magiſteriall,</hi> or ſuch, which may not lawfully be declin'd, when a man cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto it without diſobedience to God; otherwiſe, you make it ſo irrefragably ſacred, as if it were no leſſer ſin then perjurie it ſelfe, to detract it. Again, for the inveſtiture of your Elderſhip with this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, whether they arrogate it unto themſelves and are their own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or whether the Civill State and Parliamentarie Law, or whether the free and joynt conſent of thoſe over whom this power is exerciſed, do conferre and derive it upon them, you informe us not, but count an <hi>ignoramus,</hi> better then a verdict. But till you do reſolve us by what Authoritie or power this <hi>Authoritative power</hi> comes into the hand of your <hi>combined Elderſhip,</hi> we ſhall thinke it ſafer to ſtand to the hazard and dammage of all the <hi>inconveniences</hi> ſpoken of, then to ſubject to it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the Law of the State, be the firſt and moſt conſiderable band or tye upon men to ſubmit unto the power of your <hi>combined Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip</hi> (as you ſeeme here to imply, in ſaying <hi>that all men &amp; all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thereof are bound by Law, &amp;c.)</hi> then 1. you muſt acknowledge that the root and baſe of your Government is <hi>poteſtas ſecularis,</hi> ſecular
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:196793:47"/> authoritie; and then how is it Eccleſiaſtick or ſpirituall? A man may as well <hi>bring a clean thing out of an unclean</hi> (in <hi>Jobs</hi> expreſſion) as make a ſpirituall extraction out of a ſecular root. Secondly, it will reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you to prove, that the Civill State hath a power to forme and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion the government of the Churches of Chriſt. Yea, thirdly (and laſtly) it will be demonſtratively proved againſt you, that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the government of the Churches of Chriſt (in the laſt reſolution of it) into the humors, wills, and pleaſures of the world, yea of the vileſt and moſt unworthy of men. But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) the <hi>Authoritative power of your combined El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip</hi> being granted unto you, we doe not ſee how the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences you find in the Congregationall way, will bee much better ſolv'd in yours. For firſt, what if a particular Congregation under the juriſdiction of your Elderſhip, reflecting upon the Oath or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it hath taken for ſubjection thereunto, (as likewiſe upon all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engagements that way) as unlawfull, ſhall peremptorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſtand to the awards or determinations of it, what will you do in this caſe? How will your <hi>combined Elderſhip</hi> remedy this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience? What? will you excommunicate this Church? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologiſts in their way do little leſſe; (and that by a power farre leſſe queſtionable then yours) nay in your interpretation they doe every whit as much: Or will you deliver them over <hi>Brachio ſeculari?</hi> to be hamper'd and taught better then it ſeems you can teach them, by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, fines, baniſhment, &amp;c. O <hi>A. S.</hi> remember you tar'd the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts, for comporting in a very ſmall matter (in compariſon) with the Arminians (in caſe it had been true) and will you comply with the Papiſts in a matter of this high nature? Churches had need take heed how they chuſe men for their Guardians, that will ſo diſpoſe of them if they pleaſe them not. Beſides, you know what was ſaid in the ſecond chapter, touching the power of the Magiſtrate in this caſe. And what if in the Seſſion of your <hi>combined Elderſhip</hi> there be no ſuch thing as plurality of votes concerning excommunication of ſuch a Church, (as it is very poſſible that in ſuch a meeting the truth may find juſt as many friends as error hath, and no more) is not the <hi>remedy</hi> you ſpake of, now in the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt?</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly, (to touch upon the ſecond inconvenience mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) when your <hi>combined Elderſhip</hi> proceeds againſt a particular Church amongſt you, upon offence taken, is not this Elderſhip as well <hi>Party</hi> as <hi>Judge?</hi> If you think you have every whit the better of it, becauſe your Elderſhip, though it be both <hi>Party</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> yet hath
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:196793:47"/> an <hi>authoritative power</hi> over thoſe whom it judgeth: I anſwer firſt, that as our Saviour told <hi>Pilate, He could have no power againſt him, except it were given him from above;</hi> no more can your Elderſhip have over thoſe whom it judgeth in this caſe. Now how uncertain and faint the probabilities are, that they have any power over them given them <hi>from above,</hi> hath been formerly ſhewed at large. And if that power which your Elderſhip claimeth, and exerciſeth over the Church ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, be not <hi>from above,</hi> then the Apologiſts <hi>remedy</hi> is farre better and ſafer then yours. Secondly, to hold and maintain, that all thoſe that have an <hi>Authoritative power</hi> over men, may lawfully by vertue of ſuch power, be both parties and Judges, is to exalt all manner of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, violence and oppreſſion by a Law. Upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, men inveſted with authority and power, whether in Church or State, may be their own carvers, and ſerve themſelves of the eſtates, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and lives of thoſe that are under them, how, and when, &amp; as oft as they liſt. And why doe you not ſubmit to the deciſive judgment of the King in all controverſies depending between you and him, if that be your doctrine?</p>
               <p>For the third inconvenience (ſo called) I ſhall be your debtour to tell me plainly and diſtinctly, what power more your government gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to a <hi>thouſand Churches over one, then to a Tinker, or the Hangman, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a thouſand.</hi> I doe not remember where either your ſelfe, or any of your party, have calculated the proportion; but I well remember a ſaying in <hi>Charron, That every humane propoſition hath equall authoritie,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tout propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on humaine a autant d'au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorite quel' autre, ſi la rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon n'on fait la difference. Charron de ſag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uando, quibus teſtibus,</hi> did this government, or any ſon it hath, ever make any ſuch compariſon, or ſo farre honour either your <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> or <hi>Hangman,</hi> as to make them equall in power to a <hi>thouſand Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> And yet I ſuppoſe, if a man ſhould ſay, that the duſt in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance hath as much life in it as the Sunne, it would be no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this excellent and glorious creature; becauſe the excellencie of it doth not ſtand in any degrees or ſuperiority of life above any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature, but in the aboundance of light which it hath, and the height of its ſituation, and the ſerviceableneſſe of it to the world by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:196793:48"/> means of both. In like manner if it be ſuppoſed (which I think, upon what hath been delivered, may very reaſonably be ſuppoſed) that the glory and excellencie of Churches doth not ſtand in any <hi>power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> that one hath over another, or many over one, but in other farre more rich, and holy, and honourable endowments, relations, and qualifications, it can be no prejudice or diſparagement unto <hi>ten thouſand</hi> of them, to ſay they have no more authority over one, then <hi>A. S.</hi> his <hi>Tinker</hi> or <hi>Hangman</hi> hath over them. Therefore if <hi>A. S.</hi> his admired peece of Church-policie, hath no greater commendation, then to ſerve for preventing ſuch <hi>Inconveniences</hi> as this, the world needs make no great lamentation over it, though it were in the condition of <hi>Rachels children,</hi> when ſhe <hi>wept</hi> for them, and would not be <note place="margin">Matth. 2. 18.</note>

The guilt is innocencie, in reſpect of the purgation.

               <p>HE that hath read the precedent part of this diſcourſe, and doth, though but with the loweſt degree of impartialitie, conſider what hath been argued between the two wayes, Presbytery and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme, cannot lightly but mourne over the title of this chapter; and think him to be a man of iron entrails that ſhould give occaſion to ſuch a Queſtion as is there propounded.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe the opinion maintained in the latter part of the ſecond Chapter, were wav'd, and ſuch a <hi>coercive power</hi> in matters of Religion
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:196793:48"/> as <hi>A. S.</hi> contends for, allowed in the Magiſtrates hand, yet that any man ſhould plead for the drawing of this ſword againſt thoſe men, who firſt, have ſuch a conſiderable ſtrength, if not of evidence, yet of reaſon, for what they practiſe and profeſſe: ſecondly, have a like (if not a more) conſiderable ſtrength againſt that way of government which they cannot ſubmit to. Thirdly, are by their fierceſt adverſaries and oppoſites themſelves, acknowledged ten times over for <hi>very pious, godly, and learned men.</hi> Fourthly, have been (at leaſt the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of them) and ſo continue, men of the moſt affectionate, and withall the moſt effectuall activitie and forwardneſſe to promote the great cauſe of Religion, Parliament, and Kingdome. Fifthly, are as deep in, or (if you will) as much out of their eſtates rateably, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this cauſe, as any other ſort of men whatſoever. Sixthly, have (many of them) ſuch as were meet for ſuch a ſervice, adventur'd their perſons and lives, in the face of the rage and furie of the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, continuing ſtill in the ſame engagements. Yea, ſeventhly (and laſtly) have (ſome of them) expoſed themſelves to more danger, and harder termes from the adverſe party, then ordinary (in caſe they ſhould prevaile) by a publick vindication of the cauſe of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in print from the Scriptures, and that before any man of differing judgment from them in Church affairs, appeared in the cauſe upon ſuch termes; that any man (I ſay) on this ſide of malignancie, ſhould conſult the ſorrow, trouble, diſgrace, ſuppreſſion, ruine of men, ſo holy, ſo harmleſſe, of ſuch eminent deſert in the cauſe of Religion, State, Kingdome, me thinkes ſhould exceed the line of humanity, and be thought ſome inſpiration or ſuggeſtion from the great enemy of mankind.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, if either God, Reaſon, the peace or ſafety of the Kingdome, require the ſorrows or ſufferings of theſe men, I make no queſtion but they will be willing to diſpenſe with all conſiderations whatſoever that ſtand up to plead their immunitie, and will with <hi>Iſaac</hi> patiently ſuffer themſelves to be bound, yea and to be offered up in ſacrifice alſo, if need be. Onely their humble requeſt and ſuit is, that they may not be ſacrificed upon the ſervice of the ignorance, vain ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, needleſſe jealouſies, bitter ſuggeſtions, whether of a few, or of many. Better a thouſand times is it, that ſuch diſtempers as theſe, though found in millions of men, ſhould ſuffer, were it never ſo deep, then that the leaſt hair of the head of one of thoſe men ſhould fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>One <hi>A. S.</hi> (it ſeems) is come forth with a band of one and twentie
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:196793:49"/> Reaſons, to attach the liberty of theſe men, and to ſeize the fredome of their conſciences, and comforts for the uſe of the Presbytery, though his word be, <hi>For God and his Countrey.</hi> But let us give him an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall hearing of what hee hath to ſay: If the Presbyterie hath right either to the liberties or comforts of theſe men, God forbid that any man ſhould deny them unto it.</p>
               <p>Wee ſhall take the Allegations into conſideration, in that order that himſelf preſents them, in <hi>p.</hi> 61. 62, 63<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 64, 65. of his Diſcourſe; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the Reader once more, to reade the tenour of them more at large from his own pen, becauſe I intend my Anſwer with as little tranſcribing as may be.</p>
               <p>To the firſt we anſwer: firſt, that we are no wayes able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, <note place="margin">

Nay, ſecondly, wee are verily perſwaded (and that upon good grounds) that the granting unto the Apologiſts a free exerciſe of their Miniſtery, will (under God) be an effectuall means both of chaſing away of many erroneous opinions, which are (for the preſent) fighting againſt the truth of God amongſt us; as alſo of preventing the coming on of further ſupplies from Hell unto them. <hi>A.

               <p>Thirdly, (and laſtly) if the worſt ſhould come to the worſt (as the ſaying is) better <hi>a door opened to all ſorts of erroneous opinions,</hi> yea, and to many other inconveniences greater then this; then that the guilt of any perſecution, or of any evill intreatings of the Saints and ſervants of God ſhould cleave unto a people or State.</p>
               <p>To your ſecond Alledgement, why no Toleration for the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts, <note place="margin">Anſwer to his ſecond Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> we anſwer; firſt, that the very conſtitution of it is but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſneſs of fear: <hi>The ſhadow of the mountains ſeem men unto you.

               <p>Secondly, I would know of him, whether hee deemeth himſelf to be of <hi>another Religion</hi> then the Apologiſts, becauſe he diſſents in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from them about Church-government.

If God ſhould not incline the judgement, or not ſatisfie the conſcience of the one of theſe parties in relation, concerning the lawfulneſs of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Presbyteriall, which wee ſuppoſe (for argument ſake) to be eſtabliſhed without a toleration of any other, would not the party agrieved and burthened in this kinde, be (in all likelihood) worſe company for the other, more troubled, more diſcontented, and every whit as much divided, both in judgement and practice from him; yea, and more divided in affection, diſcontentment being one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemies that are, to love, union, and peace? Were it not a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times better, and more conducing unto unity in affection and peace, rather to ſuffer the diſcontented party to marry then to burn, I mean, to injoy the freedom of their conſcience, rather then to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually kept in an iron chain of ſpirituall diſcontent? We cannot but know that relations were incumbred with ſuch factions and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as <hi>A.

Excellency of teaching, and that abundant light of the knowledge of God, which hath ſhined from the Miniſtery amongſt us, into the hearts of many thouſands, have made the conſcience very ſoft and tender in many. And where

For, 1. It ſuppoſeth that malignant ſuppoſition we ſpake of, <hi>viz.</hi> that Presbyterie and Apologiſme, make two differing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. 2. That there is <hi>no State in Chriſtendome, where there is one only Religion eſtabliſhed, that will admit the publike exerciſe of any other;</hi> which is manifeſtly untrue, as is notoriouſly known in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries, &amp;c.</hi> 3. And laſtly, it ſuppoſeth, that Apologiſme, in caſe it be tolerated, muſt needs become a Schiſme in that Religion which is eſtabliſhed in the Land. Wee conceive, that every difference in judgement doth not make a Schiſme in that Religion which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed on both ſides; we ſhall then finde abundance of the weed grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Presbyterian field it ſelf. I my ſelf know differences not a few amongſt that party; and ſome not of the lighteſt conſequence. Or, if his meaning be, that the practice of it, in caſe of a Toleration, ſhould become a <hi>Schiſme</hi> from the Presbyterian Church or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee anſwer, 1. That as yet wee have no Presbyterian Church or Government amongſt us; and ſo, if the toleration be granted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a Government be eſtabliſhed, it is apparently <gap reason="foreign">

If it be not a Schiſme before, and without a toleration, I do not apprehend what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or aſpect a Toleration ſhould have upon it, to make it one. 3. And laſtly, I conceive him to be an incompetent Judge, uncapable of knowing or determining what a Schiſme is, who acknowledgeth his ignorance or non-knowledge of what a Church is, which is a <hi>A.

               <p>Your 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Reaſon, is rather ſomewhat elſe then a Reaſon; a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">His fourth Reaſon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> of the dimneſs or weakneſs of your ſight. <hi>I cannot ſee</hi> (ſay you) <hi>how</hi> (a Toleration) <hi>can well be denyed to other Sects, if it be granted to our Brethren:</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:196793:52"/> 1. Do you remember, how you quip your Brethren (as here you call them) for a like expreſſion us'd by them, <hi>pag.</hi> 41. <hi>If yee ſee no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it, yet others</hi> (you tell them) <hi>may ſee.</hi> So here wee tell you, that though <hi>you cannot ſee how</hi> a Toleration <hi>can well be denyed to other Sects, if it ſhould be granted unto your Brethren,</hi> yet others may ſee how very well it may. <hi>Bernardus non videt omnia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is much that you ſhould not be able to <hi>ſee</hi> ſuch a thing as this, who have ſuch command over your eyes (as was noted formerly) as to ſee what you will. Is it a matter of ſuch profound and difficult ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, to conceive, how hee that hath the keeping of a door with lock and key, and bolts to it, ſhould let in one man that knocks, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting in all comers?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas you determine it to be a <hi>Queſtion inextricable, to expound cleerly, what ſects and what opinions are to be tolerated, and what not,</hi> do you not prevaricate with your own cauſe and confidence, and put the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to a ſtand, whether he ſhould tolerate your opinion for Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian government, or not? Nay, do you not put him out of all hope of ever coming to a cleer reſolution of what is his duty to do in this kind? For what patent can you ſhew from heaven, why this opinion of yours ſhould not abide the teſt and triall of that law, which here you impoſe upon others? I believe there are very few, either Sects or Opinions amongſt us (in both w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> notwithſtanding we abound more then is for our comfort) that either are liable to more conſiderable and materiall exceptions, or that have been dealt with by an higher hand of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conviction, then this of yours. And why any one opinion which is in the ſame or greater condemnation of unſatisfactorineſs and ambiguity, then others, ſhould magnifie it ſelf to rule all others with a rod of iron, and to break them in pieces like a Potters veſſell, equity or reaſon, (for my part) I know none: and I fear <hi>A.

               <p n="4">4. If it be ſo <hi>inextricable a Queſtion, to expound cleerly, what ſects and opinions are to be tolerated, and what not,</hi> how will you do to ſway your Presbyterian Scepter with judgement and equity? How will you know what opinions <hi>donare Eccleſiâ,</hi> to make free denizens of your Church, and what to disfranchiſe? By your own rule it is an <hi>inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Queſtion, cleerly</hi> to determine <hi>what opinions are to be tolerated, and what not.</hi> And if the Queſtion be ſo difficult above meaſure, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what opinions are to be <hi>tolerated, and what not,</hi> it muſt needs be yet of a farre more difficult and weighty conſideration, to reſolve what are fit to be countenanced, to be eſtabliſhed, yea, and yet more,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:196793:52"/> to be impoſed, to be inforced upon the judgements and conſciences of men, <hi>and what not;</hi> toleration being an act of a farre lighter impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then either an eſtabliſhment, or an enforcement.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, whereas he addes (in the cloſe of this reaſon) that <hi>the leſſe the difference be, the greater is the ſchiſme,</hi> and addes no more; I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell who he thinks will entertain ſuch a ſaying, the old Writ of <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi> being out of date long agoe: yet the ſaying ſomewhat confirms me in what I ſaid before, <hi>viz</hi> that the man knows not what belongs to a <hi>ſchiſm.</hi> For doth he here by a <hi>ſchiſm</hi> underſtand any thing that is ſinful? Then he makes the leſſer difference from the truth, to be a greater ſin, then a greater would be. If his meaning be, that the leſſe materiall the ground or reaſon of any mans diſſenting from a major part be, the greater is his fault, or ſin, in diſſenting; We anſwer, that his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceeds, not onely <hi>a non conceſſis,</hi> but alſo <hi>a non concedendis:</hi> for to diſſent from a major part, though the grounds of a mans diſſent be no matters of deep conſequence, yet if they be ſuch wherein his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſcience are not ſatisfied, his diſſent is no <hi>ſin</hi> at all, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently cannot be the <hi>greater ſin.</hi> Gnats muſt not be ſwallowed for any mans ſake more then Camels.</p>
               <p>To his fifth Reaſon we anſwer. Firſt, that ſuppoſe <hi>God in the Old</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">His 5 reaſon anſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>Teſtament granted no toleration of divers Religions, or diſciplines,</hi> doth it follow from hence, that you ſhould grant none neither? Dare you ſay in matters of knowledge, authority and power, <hi>Ero ſimilis Altiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> you will be like the Higheſt? Remember the fall of the <hi>ſon of the morning.</hi> Will you ſet your threſhold by Gods, and compare with him for excellencie of knowledge, or infallibilitie of diſcerning? If you could aſſure us, after the rate of a divine aſſurance, that that <hi>Religion and Diſcipline</hi> which you would impoſe on us, are in all points ſound, and juſtifiable in the ſight of God, we could much better beare the height of your indignation againſt a toleration of any diſcipline or opinions but your own.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though God granted no ſuch toleration (as you ſpeak of) <hi>in terminis,</hi> yet he ſtraightly prohibited all manner of violence, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and hard meaſure among his people one towards another; and in ſpeciall manner charged it upon the conſciences of the rich, not to take any advantage of the povertie of their brethren, to exact upon them, enſlave them, and the like. Though ſuch Lawes as theſe, in the letter of them, reſpected onely civill tranſactions and dealings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween men, yet the equitie and ſpirit of them extends to ſpirituals al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, men being every whit as liable to violence, oppreſſion, and hard
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:196793:53"/> meaſure from men for their conſcience ſake, as in any other reſpects, or upon any other grounds whatſoever. Therefore in caſe there had been a minor party in that Nation, that had been of a peculiar judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by themſelves, about the ſenſe and meaning of ſuch or ſuch a Law, relating unto practice (as Lawes generally doe in one kinde or other) and ſo had diſſented in this practice from the major part of their brethren in their Nation; in caſe this major part had taken the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their brethrens weakneſſe, and becauſe they were fewer in number, ſhould have forc'd them, againſt the light of their judgments, to alter their practice, or if they refuſed, ſhould have troden and trampled upon them, or any wayes evill intreated them, it had been as apparent a breach of the Laws we ſpake of, as any oppreſſion or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in civill proceedings. And the truth is, that for men that are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſcientious, civill liberty (as it is called) <hi>i.</hi> freedome from ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall taxes, impoſitions, exactions, impriſonments, without libertie of conſcience, is an accommodation of little value; yea, without this, ſuch men are not capable of much eaſe or benefit by the other. They are ſtill in danger of being in trouble and moleſtation from the State, for their conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though God gave no ſuch toleration (as you ſpeak of) by a law, yet he did actually tolerate for a long time together with much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not onely a minor, but a major part of the Jewiſh Nation, in a manner the whole Nation, and that not only in ſome opinions or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, which were diſputably falſe or ſinfull, but even in ſuch which were notoriouſly and unqueſtionably ſuch. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> (ſaith <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13. 18.) <hi>He ſuffered</hi> (or tolerated) <hi>their manners in the wilderneſſe four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares;</hi> and afterwards in the land of Canaan, many and many a yeare longer, even <hi>till there was no remedy</hi> (as the Scripture ſomewhere ſpeaketh. So then, if you be willing to follow the practice and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God (an honour whereunto you ſeem to pretend in this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) you muſt tolerate your brethren, not onely in ſome opinions and practiſes which are dialectically and topically evill, but even in thoſe which are demonſtratively ſuch.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, whereas you adde, that <hi>the New Teſtament requireth no leſſe union among Chriſtians, then the old did amongst the Jewes,</hi> we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the truth of what you ſay, but the pertinencie of it to your purpoſe, we yet deſire. Though the <hi>New Teſtament requires union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Chriſtians,</hi> and that very ardently and preſſingly, yet it doth not require him that is ſtronger to cudgell him that is weaker into the ſame opinion with him. If you be of a better growth and ſtature
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:196793:53"/> in knowledge then we, and comprehend ſuch truths as wee doe not yet underſtand, we are moſt willing, as farre and as faſt, as meat and nouriſhment will doe it, to grow up unto you; onely we would not be rack'd or ſtretch'd to the ſame ſtature or proportion with you. We ſhewed in our ſecond Chapter, what meanes the New Teſtament hath appointed and ſanctified, for the effecting of the unitie amongſt the Saints, which it requireth of them.</p>
               <p>For your ſixt Reaſon (ſo called) wee can ſcarce ſee the face of a <note place="margin">His 1. Reaſon anſwered.</note> Reaſon in it. You ſay that if <hi>your brethren do aſſent to your Doctrine, and are reſolved likewiſe to aſſent to your Diſcipline, which ſhall be eſtabliſhed by common conſent, they need no other toleration then the reſt.</hi> If your meaning be, that in caſe <hi>they aſſent to your Doctrine, and are reſolved to aſſent to your Diſcipline, viz.</hi> immediately and out of hand, as ſoone as it comes from under the hammer, and hath but the ſtamp of Presbyteriall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ſet upon it, we are clearly of your mind, and doe not conceive, how or why they ſhould need any other alteration, then what others have. Onely we ſomewhat marvell that you ſhould ſo farre forget your ſelfe, as to imply (by this your expreſſion) that even your Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an partie it ſelfe ſtandeth <hi>in need of a toleration,</hi> as well as ours. <hi>Jam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ergo pares.</hi> Truth (I ſee) is ſometimes too quick and cunning for her adverſaries. But if your meaning be, that a reſolution <hi>in your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> (the Apologiſts) <hi>to aſſent to your Diſcipline, viz.</hi> when, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as they can poſſibly ſatisfie themſelves touching the lawfulneſſe of it, will exempt them from a neceſſitie of a Toleration, both they (we ſuppoſe) and our ſelves ſhall be very glad to heare ſuch tydings from your pen. We make no queſtion but they are as throughly <hi>reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to aſſent to your Diſcipline</hi> upon ſuch termes, as you can deſire them.</p>
               <p>That you adde, is very incongruous. <hi>It would firſt be diſcuſſed</hi> (ſay you) <hi>wherein they are reſolved to diſſent.</hi> Firſt, we marvell who you meane ſhould <hi>diſcuſſe</hi> that wherein they ſhould be <hi>reſolved to diſſent:</hi> eſpecially conſidering, Secondly, that they do not uſe to take up their reſolutions beforehand, not ſo much as to diſſent at all, much leſſe wherein or about what they ſhall diſſent. Thirdly, how ſhould they reſolve beforehand, wherein, or whereabout to diſſent, except they could prophecie of your future thoughts and reſolutions?</p>
               <p>You would further have it <hi>conſidered</hi> (but you tell us not here nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by whom) <hi>whether it be of ſo great importance, that in conſideration thereof, they dare not, in good conſcience entertain communion with you.</hi> We ſcarce underſtand your Engliſh, or meaning, here; and therefore if we
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:196793:54"/> anſwer beſides your mind, your words are in fault. We grant that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men of good abilities, conſciencee and learning, may draw up a very ſatisfactory reſolution concerning ſuch or ſuch a caſe, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, about which I am ſcrupled; but it will not follow from hence, that therfore this reſolution wil be ſatisfactory unto me, or that I with a good conſcience may walk by it. Though the particular reaſon or reaſons, one or more, upon which the Apologiſts ſhall refuſe to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a communion with you, as you mean (or at leaſt ſhould mean, if you ſpeak any thing to purpoſe) ſhould be by never ſo many, and upon never ſo much conſideration, adjudged as inſufficient, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable to cauſe any ſuch refuſall in them; yet this will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a neceſſity upon them to joyn in communion with you, except you can make them capable of a ſufficiencie of reaſon in ſuch a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion why they may with a good conſcience ſubmit unto it.</p>
               <p>To your ſeventh Reaſon we anſwer, Firſt, that though the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">His 7. Reaſon anſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhould not be preſſed to be actors in any thing againſt their conſciences,</hi> yet there is a neceſſity lying upon them <hi>to be ſuiters for a toleration,</hi> (I mean, in caſe it will not be granted them without ſuing for, which would be a greater honour to your Presbytery, then the contrary pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorineſſe is like to be) <hi>viz.</hi> that ſo they may be actors of good, according to their conſciences. Suppoſe <hi>A. S.</hi> had bread and water, wherewith to ſubſiſt, but withall had a good ſum of money due to him, and that from one that was very well able to make payment, or otherwiſe had an opportunitie to preferre himſelfe to ſome place of profit, credit, or the like, if hee would but become a ſuitor for it, would he thinke that he had no need either to require his money of him in whoſe hand it lies, or to ſue for ſuch preferment? The <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts</hi> conceive there is a neceſſity upon them, to ſave the ſouls of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yea of as many as they can lawfully purchaſe an opportunity to ſave, as well as their own. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, we know not by what authority or intereſt you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſecure them, <hi>that they ſhall not be preſſed to be actors in any thing againſt their conſciences.</hi> It may be you are but of the ordinary Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian ſtature and pitch; and ſo <hi>your mercies,</hi> though ſomewhat ſevere, yet poſſibly may not be very <hi>cruell:</hi> But (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>in thoſe dayes there were Giants in the earth,</hi> as well as men of the common <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 4.</note> ſtandard; ſo wee feare a partie amongſt you of Hyper-presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ſpirits, whoſe Spring-tides may ſwell beyond your Low-water marks. But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) we conceive this promiſe of yours to them,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:196793:54"/> 
                  <hi>that they ſhall not be preſſed to be actors,</hi> &amp;c. to be broken by your ſelfe ſeven times over in your diſcourſe, and by others of your party from time to time. To conſent unto your government, is (doubtleſſe) to act againſt their conſcience; otherwiſe they had no reaſon to diſſent from it. And whether to threaten them with a non-toleration, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the evils and miſeries attending thereon, yea with paying for it in their purſe and perſons, in caſe they will not conſent unto it, (as ſome others of your party have done) be not a <hi>preſſing</hi> of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, we leave unto men, whoſe judgments are not wholly ſwallowed up in the gulfe of Presbyterian zeal, to determine.</p>
               <p>To your eighth reaſon, we anſwer, that wee finde very little heart <note place="margin">His 8. Reaſon anſwered.</note> or face of reaſon in it. The ſtrength of it (whatever it is) lies in this hypotheticall propoſition: If it be <hi>againſt the nature of the communion of Saints to live in Sects apart, without communicating at the Lords table,</hi> then ought not the Apologiſts to bee tolerated. But, &amp;c. But good <hi>A. S.</hi> doe you conceive the men would under a toleration, live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out communicating at the Lords table? I know not what communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you have with their intentions of ſpirits, more then I: but for the preſent, I am no man of your beliefe herein. Toleration or no Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I beleeve they will communicate at the Lords Table, and that oftner then twice a yeare.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if living <hi>in Sects apart</hi> be ſo offenſive to your zeal over <hi>the communion of Saints,</hi> why do you not rather mediate a Toleration for them, then oppoſe it? If you ſhall ſuffer them to work with you, they will be ſo much the more free to eat and drink with you, and to exerciſe all manner of Chriſtian friendſhip and familiarity with you. But if you ſhall thruſt them into holes and corners, and judge them unworthy of all part and fellowſhip with you in the publick Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpel, you impoſe little leſſe then a neceſſitie upon them to <hi>live apart,</hi> and to enjoy themſelves amongſt themſelves; and beſides repreſent your ſelves unto them as no wayes deſirous of communion with them. Therefore in this reaſon your premiſſes and concluſion are at utter defiance the one againſt the other</p>
               <p>As for your ninth reaſon, it is every whit as wilde, and wide from <note place="margin">His 9. Reaſon anſwered.</note> the purpoſe as the former. For what if <hi>the Scripture exhorts us ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more unto unity,</hi> and this unitie <hi>cannot be eaſily procured by a Toleration of Sects;</hi> doth it therefore follow, that <hi>godly, learned,</hi> and <hi>orthodox men,</hi> ſuch as being encouraged, though at an under-rate, are (as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhewed) both able and likely to doe as good ſervice againſt <hi>Sects,</hi> as any men, are to be barr-hoyſted, quaſh'd, cruſh'd, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:196793:55"/> they cannot ſay, <hi>A viſion,</hi> where other men ſay it? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exhorts unto many things, which are not to be procured by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is lawfull, no nor yet by every thing that is otherwiſe neceſſary and fitting to be done. Were not this a ridiculous reaſoning, The Scripture exhorts <hi>to live godlily in this preſent world;</hi> but this cannot be procured by eating and drinking: Therefore eating and drinking are not to be tolerated. <hi>Apagecruentas nugas!</hi>

               <p>Whereas you adde, that a <hi>Toleration of Sects cannot but daily beget new Schiſmes and diviſions.</hi> We anſwer, firſt, that this allegation we have anſwered already once and againe: yet ſecondly, we adde, that many inconveniences, ſickneſſes, diſeaſes, come by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet are theſe to be tolerated in the world. Thirdly, we plead for no toleration of any Sect, (nor of any thing ſo called) but which may ſtand with the utmoſt that either <hi>A.

Fifthly and laſtly, whereas you ſay, That <hi>a Toleration of Sects cannot but daily beget new Schiſmes, &amp;c.</hi> We anſwer, firſt, that <hi>Gods toleration,</hi> or <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> towards ſinners, doth not onely <hi>lead</hi> all ſinners <hi>to repentance,</hi> but alſo bring many thereunto. And why ſhould not mans <hi>toleration</hi> expect an effect anſwerable hereunto? Secondly, the diſciples in the ſhip were as much afraid, that their dear Lord and Maſter had been a foule ſpirit, and would have ſunk them in the Sea, as <hi>A. S.</hi> is afraid of a <hi>Toleration, that it muſt needs beget new Schiſmes and diviſions daily.</hi> But as the feared Deſtroyer proved the experienced preſerver of that ſhip and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His tenth reaſon, being help'd, riſeth up in this forme, If <hi>there was a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">His 10 Reaſon anſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>greater difference amongst the members of the Church of Corinth, in the time of S. Paul, and yet they communicated together,</hi> and that by the <hi>Apoſtles exhortation,</hi> then ought not the Apologiſts to be tolerated. But true is the former, therefore the latter alſo. We anſwer, firſt, that the fabrick of your Argument is built upon a falſe foundation, or ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that the reaſon, why the Apologiſts refuſe communion with you (you mean, I ſuppoſe, in your ſacramentall actions) is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the latitude, weight or degree of the differences in iudgment
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:196793:55"/> between you and them: whereas the reaſon of their refuſall in this kinde, is the nature or particularity of the difference, together with your practice depending upon your opinion in oppoſition unto theirs, not the height, weight, or importance of either. A difference in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about the lawfulneſs of ſtinted forms of prayer, is nothing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall or weighty, as a difference about the nature of Faith, Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. yet the lighter difference in this caſe, makes perſons ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, uncapable of joyning together in Communion, in the uſe of ſuch prayers; whereas the greater difference would not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if there were ſo many and great <hi>differences amongst the members of the Church of Corinth,</hi> as you ſpeak of; and yet <hi>Paul</hi> no wayes perſwaded or incouraged the predominant or major party amongſt them, either to caſt out, cut off, or ſuppreſs the underling parties, but <hi>exhorted them unto mutuall communion, &amp;c.</hi> Why do not you content your ſelf with the line of the ſame proceſs, and in ſtead of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing, quaſhing, cruſhing, trampling on, only exhort the Sects and Schiſmes amongſt you unto <hi>mutuall communion;</hi> and to the <hi>forbearance of Sects and Diviſions?</hi> a practice which you do well to take notice of in the Apoſtle, but do ill to think that your own of club-law is better.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) nor do wee know any ground or good bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome you have for your aſſumption, wherein you affirm, that <hi>there was greater difference amongst the members of the Church of Corinth,</hi> then is between the Apologiſts and you.

S.</hi> himſelf ſymbolizeth with <hi>Neſtorius</hi> the Heretique in one property; of whom <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> reporteth, that <hi>to make way for his own hereſie</hi> [or opinion] <hi>hee fell heavie upon all hereſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</hi> Secondly, whereas he affirmeth, that <hi>the opinion of his Brethren is not unlike to the Convents and Monaſteries amongst the Papiſts;</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the unlikeneſs between them is far greater, then that between an Apple and an Oiſter. We cannot but wonder, how, or in what reſpect, the man ſhould conceive, that an inward, ſpirituall and notionall
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:196793:56"/> thing, as an opinion is, ſhould be like a great building made of lime and ſtone, or a pack of die fellows in a fat Fraternity. Thirdly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hee inſinuates a hatefull ſimilitude between his <hi>Brethren</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſts, who</hi> (hee tels us) <hi>ſeparated themſelves from other Churches, under pretext that they were not ſo holy as their own;</hi> We anſwer, firſt, that this inſinuation will not ſo much as in ſhew touch all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts however, becauſe ſome of them (we believe) have no <hi>Churches of their own;</hi> and therefore they cannot pretend more holineſs in them, then in others. Secondly, that neither in ſubſtance or truth doth it touch any of them, or their opinion. For, firſt they do not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from other Churches, but only in ſuch opinions and practices wherein they cannot get leave of their conſciences to joyn with them; the one half (at leaſt) of which ſeparation, is made even amongſt their Churches themſelves, one from another; one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting from another, not only in many opinions, but in ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall practices (as before was touch'd, and that from <hi>A. S.</hi> his own pen, no wayes partiall you may think in ſuch a caſe.) Secondly, we would know whether <hi>A. S.</hi> himſelf and his party, doth not as much <hi>ſymbolize with the Donatiſts</hi> in that criticall property or practice we ſpeak of, as the Apologiſts. For under what pretext do they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and from Epiſcopall Churches, but only this, that they think <hi>not their Churches, to be as holy as their own?</hi> If they ſeparate from them upon any other grounds, it were not much materiall, though they held communion with them ſtill. Yea, thirdly, if they do not think their Presbyteriall Churches <hi>more holy</hi> then the Congregationall, they are far more guilty of Schiſme and Separation, then their Brethren here ſpoken of. For then they are at liberty in point of conſcience, to come over and joyn with them; when as the other are in bands and fetters of conſcience, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs unto them. Their Brethren would gladly come over unto them, but cannot: they can come over unto theſe but will not. It is the will, not the act, that makes Schiſme and Separation. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we do not ſee, as deep as you have laid the charge, wherein the Apologiſts do any whit more ſymbolize with Convents, Monaſteries, or Orders, amongſt the Papiſts, then you and your friends. You tell them, that <hi>all their Churches believe one Doctrine together with you, and that every one of theſe Churches hath one Miniſter, as the</hi> Popiſh <hi>Convents a particular Abbot or Prior.</hi> Wee pray you, do not <hi>all your Churches believe one Doctrine together? and hath not every one of your Churches one Miniſter?</hi> Wherein then lies the difference between
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:196793:56"/> you and them? or wherein do they ſymbolize more with Convents or Monaſteries, then your ſelf? Nay, (fifthly and laſtly) as if you had quite forgotten your rhomb, you tacitely couple your ſelf with thoſe Popiſh Convents, Monaſteries, and Orders, in one ignoble conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, from which you acquit your Brethren. <hi>They only differ</hi> (ſay you to them) <hi>in this, that yee have no Generall, or any thing anſwerable thereunto, to keep you in unity and conformity;</hi> plainly implying, that your Presbyterians have, <hi>viz.</hi> their ſoveraign Judicatory. So that if this your reaſon ſhould but take place, and be held valid, it is your Presbyterian party, not the party Apologizing, that ought to ſuffer the non-toleration you ſpeak of; it being they, not theſe, that are the great ſymbolizers with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Secondly, where we argued againſt ſuch a power by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall demonſtrations. Thirdly, where we gave an account alſo, how Toleration is no way either to Schiſme, Hereſie, &amp;c. So that that there is not one <hi>apex</hi> or <hi>ieta</hi> of this Reaſon remaining unanſwered.</p>
               <p>The Logico-Divinity of your thirteenth Reaſon, conſiſteth in this <note place="margin">His 13. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Anſwered.</note> Enthymeme. <hi>If we have but one God, one Chriſt, and one Lord, one Spirit, one Faith, one Baptiſme, (whereby we enter into the Church) and are one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, we ought to have one Communion, whereby to be ſpiritually fed,</hi> and <hi>one Diſcipline to be ruled by:</hi> and if ſo, then ought not the Apologiſts to be tolerated. We anſwer, that neither doth your inference or concluſion here at all follow from your premiſſes. We have all you ſpeak of, one, one, and one; and in regard of that multiplied unitie, <hi>we ought</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>to have one Communion, and one Diſcipline;</hi> But firſt, not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>Communion,</hi> or <hi>that Diſcipline,</hi> which are of Claſſique inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no more then thoſe which are either of Papall, or Epiſcopall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation; becauſe, though wee judge theſe two latter ſpirits more ſphalmaticall, erroneous and dangerous then the firſt, yet wee cannot think, that either the Pope or Biſhops, or both together, have ſo ingroſſed the ſpirit of erreour and fallibility, but that they have left of that anointing more then enough to initiate all other Orders, Societies, and Profeſſions of men in the world. Secondly, though wee <hi>ought to have one Communion and Diſcipline,</hi> yet ought wee to be led into this unity, by the hand of an Angel of light, not to be frighted into it by an evill angel of fear and terrour. Thirdly, that duty which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:196793:57"/> lies upon all Chriſtians, <hi>to have but one Communion and Diſcipline</hi> amongſt them, is no diſpenſation unto any party or number of them, to ſmite their Brethren with the fiſt of uncharitableneſs, or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount them from their miniſteriall ſtandings in the Church, becauſe they will not, or rather cannot knit and joyn in the ſame Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Diſcipline with them. Nay, fourthly, that very tye of duty which lies upon all Chriſtians <hi>to have but one</hi> and the ſame <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Diſcipline</hi> amongſt them, carries this ingagement upon them all along with it, to ſhew all love, to uſe all manner of gentleneſs and long ſuffering towards thoſe that are contrary minded to them either in the one or in the other, ſince love is not only a ſodering and uniting affection, but further commends the perſon in whom it is found, as one to whom God hath appeared, and who hath been taught by him. Therefore fifthly (and laſtly) to make the ingagement that lies upon all Chriſtians to <hi>have but one Communion and Diſcipline,</hi> a ground and reaſon why ſuch as differ from others about theſe, ſhould be evill intreated, ſuppreſſed, kept under hatches, or the like, is as if a man ſhould plead that naturall affection which a parent ows unto his children, for a ground and motive why he ſhould ſharply ſcourge them when they are ſick and weak.</p>
               <p>His fourteenth Reaſon is of an unknown ſtrength (at leaſt to me) <note place="margin">His 14. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon anſwered.</note> If I were a Magiſtrate, I ſhould never the more know how to prepare to battell againſt the Apologiſts or any other godly perſon, for the ſound of this trumpet. Surely, of all the reſt, this Reaſon will never be acceſſary to the undoing of theſe men. However, let a poor man be heard in his cauſe. The Reaſon then with all the help it is capable of, riſeth up but thus. <hi>If Churches have Diſciplines or Governments different in their ſpecies, then the Churches muſt be different in their ſpecies alſo. But the conſequent is falſe,</hi> ſince there is but one Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Apologiſme is intolerable. They that can gather this concluſion out of the premiſſes, may very well hope <hi>to gather Grapes of Thorns, and Figs of Thiſtles.</hi> The conſequent in this argument, which the Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſaith, is falſe, is this, <hi>Churches muſt be different in their ſpecies.</hi> If the meaning of this <hi>conſequent</hi> be, that there is an abſolute neceſſity, that Churches ſhould <hi>differ ſpecie</hi> one from another, the Diſputant is in the truth, in ſaying the <hi>conſequent</hi> is falſe. Or if the meaning be, that Churches ought to <hi>differ ſpecie</hi> one from another, the ſame verdict may ſtill paſs upon it. But upon that ſuppoſition which is made in the Antecedent of this argument, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe Churches <hi>have Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciplines or Governments different in their ſpecies,</hi> the <hi>conſequent</hi> is not

               <p>But is there nothing more in the Reaſon then this? Truly, if <hi>A. S.</hi> hides the treaſure of his minde ſo deep another time, digge for it who will for mee. For this once I have taken pains to finde it; and have found ſomewhat which I conceive is like to it, if not Identically it. The man (I take it) would be here conceived to reaſon after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>If the Church of Chriſt ought to be ruled or governed, only with one ſpecies or kinde of government, then ought not they to be ſuffered, who go about to pluralize this government, or to ſet up a kind of government in the Church, ſpecifically differing from the government more generally practiſed and eſtabliſhed. Sed verum prius: Ergo &amp; poſterius:</hi> and conſequently the Apologiſts being men that would do ſuch a thing as this, are not to be tolerated. If this be the argument, this is the Anſwer. Firſt, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is lame, and halts right down; becauſe, though the Church of Chriſt ought to be governed with one and the ſame kinde of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment throughout the world, yet it no wayes follows from hence, that therefore that government which is more generally eſtabliſhed and practiſed in the world, ſhould be that ſpecificall government whereby it ought to be governed. If this conſequence were good, it would highly be friend the government Pontifician, but diſſolve and deſtroy the government Presbyterian; becauſe the Pontifician govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is, (or at leaſt not long ſince was) far more oecumenicall, and comprehenſive, then the Presbyterian either is, or is like to be. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in framing this conſequence, the man hath given ſentence againſt himſelf and his own beloved opinion touching Church-Diſcipline; and hath put a ſword into the Popes hand to ſmite as well the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorian, as the Congregationall government. And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe the government more generally practiſed in the world, be that very kinde of government, whereby the Churches of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:196793:58"/> Chriſt ought to be governed; yet, except this government, both as touching the lawfulneſs and neceſſity of it, be ſufficiently cleered to the judgement and conſciences of thoſe, from whom ſubmiſſion to it is required (an honour whereunto <hi>A. S.</hi> his government hath not yet been preferred by all his great friends) they ought not to be ſcourged with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s Scorpions, if they demurre a while about their ſubmiſſion thereunto; and in the mean ſeaſon, deſire to live under ſuch a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein they have double and treble ſatisfaction, both in point of lawfulneſs and neceſſity, above the other. Thirdly, and laſtly, though unity and uniformity in government be very fitting and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary throughout the Churches of Chriſt, yet that the ſervants of Chriſt ſhould fall foul one upon another, and the greater eat up the leſs for this uniformity ſake, is no wayes neceſſary; eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that God (as hath been formerly ſhewed) hath provided other means far more gracious, honourable and proper, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bleſſedneſs of this uniformity upon his Churches in due time. So that if there be any thing in this Reaſon, it is altogether with, and not at all againſt the Apologiſts.</p>
               <p>To your fifteenth, wee anſwer, firſt, be it ſuppoſed, (which yet <note place="margin">His 15. Reaſon anſwered.</note> wee ſhall preſently oppoſe) that <hi>neither Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles ever granted any toleration to divers Sects and Governments in the Church;</hi> yet did he or they ever grant a power to a major part of Profeſſours in a Kingdom or Nation, to grind the faces of their Brethren, <hi>partakers of like precious faith</hi> and holineſs with them, either becauſe they could not in all points jump with them in their judgements, or becauſe they endeavoured to keep a good conſcience toward God, for following the ducture and guidance of their preſent light? If you will <hi>take without asking that,</hi> which <hi>neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles ever granted</hi> you, you may very well bear it at the hands of your Brethren, if they humbly <hi>ſue</hi> and intreat for what they never granted; eſpecially conſidering that that which you <hi>take</hi> is imperious and high, tending to the annoyance and trouble of many; whereas that which they <hi>ſue</hi> for, is moderate and low, only a peaceable ſtanding amongſt you, that they may be able to do good unto many. Secondly, if <hi>neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>ever granted any toleration to divers Sects and Governments in his Church,</hi> how come you and your Government to be <hi>tolerated,</hi> your Government being ſpecifically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified from that of the Papacy (as is before obſerved) which is more generall and extenſive then yours? If you have not a toleration for your government, either from Chriſt or his Apoſtles, we are doubtfull
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:196793:58"/> from whom, or whence you have it. Thirdly, doe you not by this reaſon build up the walls of Babylon, and ſtrengthen the Papiſts in their bloody errour, againſt the reformed Churches, upon which they looke as ſchiſmaticall from their Mother, and in that reſpect think them no wayes fit to be <hi>tolerated,</hi> but to be ſuppreſſed both in their doctrine and government, yea and in caſe they will not be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the principles of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be wholly extirpated and rooted out of the world? What can be ſpoken more to the heart of ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and counſels, and reſolutions as theſe, then that <hi>neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles ever granted any toleration to divers Sects and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in the Church?</hi> Fourthly, whereas you ſay, that they <hi>granted no toleration to divers Sects,</hi> do you not imply, that they did grant a <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi> to ſome <hi>one Sect</hi> at leaſt, if not to more. And how know you whether the Sect of <hi>Apologiſme</hi> (in your improperating ſtile) be not that Sect, or one of thoſe Sects, to which Chriſt and his Apoſtles (it ſeems) granted a <hi>toleration?</hi> Is it not (I appeale to your judgement and conſcience) as like to be this as any other? Fifthly, we willingly grant your concluſion in this Reaſon, <hi>ſenſu ſano;</hi> that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the <hi>Apologiſts</hi> ſhould <hi>ſue for a toleration,</hi> no nor yet properly, why they ſhould be <hi>tolerated (toleration</hi> in propriety of ſignification, as was formerly noted, being <hi>rei malae,</hi> appliable onely to that which is evill) but rather why they ſhould be countenanced and encouraged. Therefore if you think that they ſhall ſin in <hi>ſuing for a toleration,</hi> you ſhall doe well to prevent that ſin in them (and perhaps ſhall withall prevent a greater of your owne) by declaring them perſons worthy not of a <hi>toleration,</hi> but of encouragement; or at leaſt by procuring them a <hi>toleration,</hi> that they may not be put upon the tentation of ſuing for it. But ſixthly and laſtly, to the main frame of your Reaſon: what doe you think of <hi>Sinite utrunque creſcere, Let both grow together untill the Harveſt,</hi> Matth. 13. 30. Is not here the <hi>toleration granted</hi> which you deny to be <hi>granted? Non laclacti, nec ovum ovo ſimilius;</hi> If it bee not this <hi>toleration,</hi> certainly it is ſomewhat as like to it as like may be. You know who the Houſholder is, that gave this order, laid this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon his ſervants; otherwiſe the 37. verſe will informe you. And who doe you think ſhould be meant by the <hi>tares?</hi> You will not ſay, the good ſons of the Church, at leaſt ſo acknowledged by their Mother. You cannot ſay (with reaſon) the looſe, vicious, &amp;c. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſordered ſons of the Church, becauſe theſe were ſown in the field before the <hi>Houſholder ſew that good ſeed</hi> therein (ſpoken of v. 24. and 38.) whereas <hi>the tares,</hi> which muſt be let <hi>grow to harveſt,</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:196793:59"/> ſaid to have been ſown after, v. 25. And beſides ſuch wicked and vicious perſons as theſe, at leaſt as the danger and degree of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe may be, ought to be gathered out of the State (and then they cannot <hi>grow in the field till harveſt)</hi> by the hand of the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. Therefore thirdly (and laſtly) you muſt by <hi>the tares,</hi> of neceſſity underſtand, ſuch in the Church as you call <hi>Sectaries, Schiſmaticks, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes,</hi> ſuch as corrupt the purity of the doctrine of the Goſpel, by erroneous and falſe opinions, or at leaſt are look'd upon by the greater part of the reſpective Churches of Chriſt, as ſuch. Which yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears further, by the reaſon which the Houſholder renders unto his ſervants, why he would not have them pluck'd up, but grow untill the harveſt, <hi>leſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whileſt yee goe about to gather the tares, yee pluck up the wheat alſo.</hi> There is no danger of hurting or plucking up the wheat, <hi>i.</hi> the children of the Kingdome, v. 38. by puniſhing civill or morall miſdemeanours of men; but if Magiſtrates or others ſhall be buſie about plucking up Sectaries, Heretiques, &amp;c. they will be in continuall danger <hi>of plucking up the wheat.</hi> Firſt, becauſe many truly pious and conſcientious men, <hi>children of the Kingdome,</hi> may ſoon be drawne into ſome unwarrantable Sect and opinion: And ſecondly, ſuch opinions as are ſentenced by the generality or major part of a Church, as erroneous or hereticall, and ſo expoſe thoſe that hold them to the reprochfull names of Sectaries, Schiſmatiques, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, very often fall out to be the ſacred truths of God, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons holding them forth unto the world, the beſt and faithfull eſt of his ſervants.</p>
               <p>For your ſixteenth reaſon, it concerneth others more then the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologiſts,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">His 16.

I make no queſtion, but if they had but the correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>A. S.</hi> his Relation, they would be able to make more reaſon and equity of it, then without ſome correction or other, I am able to doe. But (to leave our brethren in New-England to their own Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie) I would fain know of <hi>A. S.</hi> what he means to do with his ſtory; or how he intends to bring it under contribution to his cauſe. For firſt, he doth not onely not approve of thoſe proceedings, which he rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but is very paſſionate and intemperate in the very relation.</p>
               <q>Delicti fles idem reprehenſor, &amp; Author?</q>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:196793:59"/>
               <p> Is the man ſo full of the ſpirit of reprehenſion againſt ſuch practiſes, and yet ſo full of the ſpirit of imitation alſo? Or what? Is his deſire ſo great, to appropriate or ingroſſe the power and practice of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting for difference in religion to himſelfe and his own party, that he is not able patiently to beare the ſight of either in others? If your brethren in New-England ſtumbled at the ſtone you ſpeak of, <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> (as you ſay) thoſe that <hi>were approved by themſelves both for their life and doctrine, meerly becauſe they differed a little from them in point of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> you have a faire warning; take heed that you doe not ſtumble at the ſame ſtone alſo. They (it's like) juſtified themſelves in themſelves, in thoſe proceedings, though they did not ſo in the fight of God; but if you, having condemned them in what they did, ſhall nevertheleſſe run the ſame courſe, you wil be both <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, both ſelf-condemned, and God-condemned alſo, and ſo have no cloak nor ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for your ſin.</p>
               <p>But you think it no wayes reaſonable, that the <hi>Apologiſts,</hi> being of the <hi>ſame profeſſion,</hi> (as you ſpeak) <hi>ſhould be ſuiters for a toleration in Old-England.</hi> We anſwer, firſt, if you ſpeak with reference to thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings immediatly before reported by you, you are more of the <hi>ſame profeſſion</hi> with them, then your brethren the <hi>Apologiſts.</hi> Theſe doe not profeſſe perſecution <hi>meerly for a little difference in point of Diſcipline;</hi> the world knowes who they are that do little leſſe. Secondly, what though men of the ſame <hi>profeſſion</hi> with them, miſcarried for want of ſuch light, as ſhould have directed them in a better way; muſt this be a band of conſcience upon them, to <hi>bow down their backes</hi> without any more adoe, and to ſuffer Presbyterian greatneſſe to <hi>go over them, as the ſtones in the ſtreet?</hi> Nay thirdly, they have the more reaſon and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, in regard of ſuch a miſcarriage of their brethren, <hi>to ſue for a toleration</hi> here; becauſe by that miſcarriage of theirs, they are awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to expect and feare yet far harder meaſure from you and your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if they doe not beſtirre themſelves by ſome means or other to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. He that feeles the ſmart of rods to be grievous, hath the more reaſon, not the leſſe, to take heed of being beaten with Scorpions. Fourthly (and laſtly) why ſhould you any wayes be againſt your brethren ſuing for a toleration, when as there lies a neceſſity upon you to grant it or conſent to it, unleſſe you mean to ſteere that New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land courſe, which you have with ſo high a hand of indignation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted with, in this very reaſon? Except (haply) you have this ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reach in it, for your reputations, that you would <hi>honeſt is precibus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currere,</hi> prevent all honeſt and reaſonable requeſts with the early for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:196793:60"/> of your bountie. If I could reaſonably thinke this to bee your deſigne, I would ſeriouſly perſwade with the <hi>Apologiſts</hi> to wave their ſuit for a toleration, and ſo to gratifie you with an honourable opportunitie of doing good, before you were provoked by any mans ſuit or motion to it.</p>
               <p>But men that are ſubject to feares, are ſeldome ſons of bounty. The bottome (it ſeems) of all that <hi>A. S.</hi> hath pleaded throughout his Diſcourſe, againſt the <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>Apologiſme,</hi> is a ſolemne <hi>fear</hi> that poſſeſſeth him, of being <hi>ſent</hi> he and <hi>all</hi> his partie <hi>into ſome Iſle of Dogs,</hi> if the congregationall men <hi>had</hi> but <hi>the upper hand over them. Omne ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midum natura querulum.</hi> But I can hardly beleeve that the man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally afraid of what he here pretendeth; (in which caſe he were rather to be pitied, then roundly dealt with) firſt, becauſe himſelfe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that ſome of <hi>his brethren</hi> hold, that all <hi>Sects and opinions</hi> are to be <hi>tolerated,</hi> p. 6. So that in caſe theſe men ſhould have the upper hand, he is aſſured of a partie at leaſt among them, to ſecure him and his in that kind. Secondly, he confeſſeth again and again, that his brethren are <hi>very pious and holy men;</hi> and therefore certainly will not be ſo dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as to ſend him and his into any <hi>Iſle of Dogs.</hi> Thirdly, a poore <hi>tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is as far from a ſuperioritie of power, as rags are from the robe, or the dunghill from the throne. Fourthly, I doe not think that he knowes any ſuch Iſle as he ſpeaks of, whereinto he fears to be ſent, by the men of his indignation. Fifthly and laſtly, if he ſhould be ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome <hi>Iſle of Dogs,</hi> the ſoyle and climate might probably agree well with him; he hath learned (it ſeems) to bark and bite too, againſt his ſending thither.</p>
               <p>To conclude, for this Reaſon, Whereas feare indeed ordinarily makes men cruell, it is much to be feared, <hi>A. S.</hi> onely pretends feare, that ſo he may have a colour to be cruell.</p>
               <p>To his ſeventeenth Reaſon we anſwer. Firſt, that the <hi>Scripture doth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">His 17. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon anſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>not forbid all,</hi> nor any <hi>ſuch Toleration</hi> as the <hi>Apologiſts</hi> deſire. This was ſufficiently ſhewed before in our anſwer to the fifteenth Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. His proofe from <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 20. holds no intelligence at all with his purpoſe; yea, it makes ſore againſt himſelfe and his Synedrion. For firſt, by the <hi>toleration</hi> or <hi>ſuffering of Jezabel,</hi> which is there charged as a ſinfull neglect upon the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> is not meant a Civill or State-toleration, but an Eccleſiaſtick or Church-toleration. This Church ſuffered falſe Doctrines to be taught in her very boſome, and her members to bee corrupted and endangered thereby, from day to day, without laying it to heart being a matter of that ſad
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:196793:60"/> conſequence) and without calling thoſe to an account that were the ſowers of ſuch tares, broachers &amp; ſpreaders of ſuch opinions; yea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing any means, to have the truth ſoundly taught in oppoſition to ſuch Doctrines. Both Paſtour and people (it ſeems) <hi>ſlept</hi> together, whilſt the <hi>envious man,</hi> by his Agent and Factreſs <hi>Jezabel, ſowed theſe tares</hi> in their field. Such a toleration as this wee formerly ſhewed to be ſinfull; and the Apologiſts are as much againſt it as you; ſo far are they from deſiring it, or ſuing for it. They deſire a Toleration for themſelves and their Churches in the Civill ſtate; not that the errours which ſpring up in their Churches, ſhould be ſuffered to fret like gangrens, without being oppoſed by them, or be protected by the State. Secondly, whereas that particular Church alone is charged by Chriſt, with this toleration or <hi>ſufferance of Jezabel,</hi> and not any more Churches, whether neighbours or not neighbours to her, nor any <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined Elderſhip,</hi> or <hi>ſtate Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> made of the conſociation of the ſeven Churches, much leſs any ſtate civill, evident it is, that the care and power of redreſſing emerging enormities or evils in a Church in every kinde, is committed by Chriſt to every particular Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, within it ſelf. And ſo <hi>they that trouble the Church</hi> muſt (as you ſay) <hi>be cut off.</hi> But by whom? not by the civill Magiſtrate (if the trouble be ſpirituall) nor by the combined Elderſhip, but by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church it ſelf, which is troubled by them, in caſe there be no remedy otherwiſe. Secondly, when you ſay, that <hi>there muſt be no ſuch ſpeeches among us, as I am of Paul, I am of Apollos,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nor that ſome are Calvinians, ſome Independenters, ſome Browniſts,</hi> &amp;c. And again, <hi>that we muſt all be Chriſts, wee muſt all think and ſpeak the ſame thing, otherwiſe men are carnall,</hi> &amp;c. (with ſome other good words to like purpoſe) we joyn heart and hand with you in all theſe things, and are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the beſt of our endeavours unto yours, if yee will ſuffer us, to make the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of God amongſt us, <hi>according to this pattern</hi> which you ſhew unto us. Such expreſſions, <hi>I am of Paul, I of Apollos,</hi> &amp;c. together with the names of <hi>Calvinians, Independents, Browniſts,</hi> &amp;c. are as un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, every man that ſaith, <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> or, <hi>I am of Apollos,</hi> is not to be taught by <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Briars,</hi> (as <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:196793:61"/> to correſpond with God in his ends, but we muſt keep as cloſe to him in his meanes alſo. Secondly, whereas you ſay, <hi>we must all be Chriſts;</hi> ſurely there is none of thoſe Sects you ſpeak of, but are willing to joyn with you in being his, and in being called by his Name, rather then by any other. We fear, theſe unhappie ſounds, of <hi>Independents, Browniſts, Anabaptiſts,</hi> &amp;c. are more frequently made of your breath, then of the breath of any other ſort, or ſect of men amongſt us. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas you adde, <hi>Neither hath the Church of God a cuſtome to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious;</hi> the Apoſtle indeed ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. <hi>that the Churches of God have no ſuch cuſtome;</hi> but he doth not ſay, that theſe <hi>Churches of God</hi> had any cuſtome, to erect a Presbyterian throne, or a <hi>combined elderſhip</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, to keep them from contentions. Fourthly, whereas you tell us, that <hi>neither permitteth the Apoſtle Schiſmes;</hi> we tell you, that we have already told you (and that once and again) both in what ſenſe he permitteth them, and in what not, and have ſhewed you our concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with him in both. Fifthly (and laſtly) in that you tell us, that <hi>we muſt not quit our mutuall meetings, as others do, and as muſt</hi> (you ſay) <hi>be done in a publique Toleration,</hi> we neither well underſtand the ſenſe of your words, much leſs any purport in them to your pupoſe. We do not know what <hi>quitting</hi> of <hi>meetings</hi> there is like to be more, under a <hi>publique toleration,</hi> then is for the preſent.</p>
               <p>Your eighteenth Reaſon is ſo Atheologicall, and unworthy your <note place="margin">His 18. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Anſwered.</note> cauſe, that the very naming of it might be Anſwer ſufficient. <hi>A to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi> (ſay you) <hi>cannot but expoſe your Churches unto the calumnies of Papiſts, who evermore object unto Proteſtants the innumerable number of theſe Sects, whereas they pretend to be nothing but one Church.</hi> Will you redeem your ſelfe out of the hand of Popiſh calumnies, by ſymbolizing with them? will you turne Turk, that you may not ſuffer Turkiſh inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and thraldome? Surely you forget your argument inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in your eleventh Reaſon: There you make <hi>ſymbolizing</hi> with Papiſts, a reaſon againſt your Brethren and their Opinions, why they ſhould not be tolerated; and here you make a defect or want in them of ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizing with them, a reaſon likewiſe why they ſhould not be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. It ſeems contradictions, inconſiſtences, impertinences, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligibilities, ſenſe, nonſenſe, any thing, nothing, will ſerve to make reaſons againſt the poor Independenters (as you call them) why they muſt not be tolerated. Was not the conſideration of your own, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. <hi>that the Devill evermore aſſaults more the true Church, the true Doctrine, and true Diſcipline, then the corrupted Church, her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Doctrine or Diſcipline,</hi> a far better ſanctuary for your Churches
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:196793:61"/> againſt thoſe Popiſh calumnies you ſpeak of, then a correſpondence with them, <hi>to keep you in unity and conformity?</hi> But this Reaſon we have anſwered formerly.</p>
               <p>Your nineteenth Reaſon, is very conciſe. In this you only ſay, that <note place="margin">His 19. reaſon anſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>of ſuch a Toleration follows all you formerly deduced out of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi> And ſo it may without putting the world to much damage, or ſorrow. When we caſt up your <hi>deductions</hi> of inconveniencies <hi>out of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency,</hi> wee found them counterballanced to the height with the exits from Presbyterie. If you poyſe your wallet well, you will the end that hangs at your back the heavier. But for anſwer to this Reaſon, I refer the Reader to the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>His twentieth Reaſon, is ſomewhat of a differing ſtrain from the <note place="margin">His 20. reaſon anſwered.</note> reſt. The ground and bottome of it ſeems to be, a deſire of a plauſible inſinuation with the Aſſembly, under a pretence of jealouſie over them, leſt they ſhould ſuffer in point of honour, in caſe his Brethren ſhould obtain a Toleration. But firſt, good <hi>A. S.</hi> why muſt it needs be thought, in caſe <hi>it ſhould be granted</hi> unto them, <hi>that it was extorted by force of Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>that all the Aſſembly were not able to anſwer your Brethren?</hi> This ſuggeſtion ſmels of worſe blood about the heart, then all the Reaſons hitherto; Fearing (it ſeems) that all ingagements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Aſſembly in point of conſcience to deny the Apologiſts a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, might fail, and prove ineffectuall that way; hee ſeeks here to ingage them in point of honour, by way of reſerve; telling them (in effect) that howſoever their conſciences might favour the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendenters in point of Toleration, yet their credits and reputations would ſuffer by it. Yet let the ſuggeſtion be but a little look'd into, and it will be found to reflect no great matter of grace or commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Aſſembly it ſelf. For if no favour or courteſie can be <hi>thought</hi> to come from them, but that which is <hi>extorted by reaſon,</hi> and the deniall whereof they <hi>cannot anſwer,</hi> it is a ſign that they are not, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Whereas hee adds, <hi>that their opinion and demands are againſt all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and that <hi>ſundry of them could not deny</hi> as much, <hi>and had nothing to ſay, but that it was Gods Ordinance.</hi> Wee anſwer, firſt, that what <hi>A.

Firſt, for their opinion, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:196793:62"/> that ſomewhat more then non-ſenſe or irrationalities, hath been argued by themſelves in the Aſſembly for it: Is it like, <hi>that very learned men, and of abilities to diſpute their opinion in any Aſſembly in Europe</hi> (which are <hi>A. S.</hi> own letters of recommendation on their behalf) ſhould riſe up to defend an opinion that is contrary <hi>to all reaſon?</hi> And ſomewhat like unto reaſon (at leaſt ſo called, amongſt our vulgar ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions) hath been ſaid for it in the preceding part of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And ſecondly, for their Demands; though <hi>A. S.</hi> doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us what they are, or wherein that fiery conteſtation <hi>againſt all reaſon,</hi> which he findes in them, conſiſts, yet we ſuppoſe, he means their <hi>ſuing for a Toleration,</hi> that high miſdemeanor, for which he hath judged them now theſe ten times. Was it, or is it, or would it be <hi>againſt all reaſon,</hi> for the poor Proteſtant Churches in <hi>France,</hi> to ſue for a <hi>Toleration</hi> in the ſtate, if it were not granted unto them without ſuing? Or is it not much more agreeable <hi>to reaſon,</hi> that Proteſtant Churches ſhould be <hi>tolerated</hi> in a Proteſtant State, then in a State Pontificiall; eſpecially in ſuch a Proteſtant State, of which they have ſo eminently deſerved, as the Apologiſts and their Churches, and men of their judgement have done of this, as was briefly touched in the beginning of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Or is it <hi>againſt all reaſon,</hi> that thoſe perſons in the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> between whoſe judgements there is that known variety of differences in matters of Religion, and which concern the worſhip of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able ſo well to accommodate themſelves for livelihood and ſubſiſtence in any other State, with the freedome of their conſciences ſhould deſire a <hi>Toleration</hi> in that? Suppoſe thoſe men of your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of whom you ſpeak, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. who were (as you there ſay) <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death for their Diſcipline, ready to be executed, and were afterwards exiled into forrain countreys;</hi> Suppoſe (I ſay) theſe men had deſired a <hi>Toleration</hi> in their own countrey, of thoſe who thus unreaſonably dealt with them, had they violated all Rules and Principles of <hi>Reaſon</hi> by ſuch a deſire? But the truth is, that the aſſertion is ſo notoriouſly <hi>againſt all reaſon,</hi> that it is ſcarce conſiſtent with reaſon to beſtow ſo much pen in anſwer to it. There is but one only ſuppoſition to make either reaſon or truth of it; if it be granted, it may paſſe for both. If the deſires of ſome Presbyterians be <hi>All Reaſon,</hi> and nothing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but they, then both the Opinion and Demands of the Apologiſts, muſt be acknowledged to be againſt all Reaſon. But otherwiſe I know no principle or rule of reaſon at all ſo much as diſcourteſied by either.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas you ſay, that <hi>ſundry of themſelves could not deny it,</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:196793:62"/> 
                  <hi>and had nothing to ſay, &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, certain I am, that ſome of them have abſolutely denied any ſuch confeſſion. Secondly, the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe looks no more like any of the reſt, then a meer fiction doth the Relator. I beleeve that upon inquirie it will be found a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion of truth. For doth it not ſound aloud incredibilitie, that men of ſufficient <hi>abilities to diſpute their opinion in any Aſſembly in Europe,</hi> ſhould confeſſe their <hi>Opinion and Demands to be againſt all reaſon?</hi> But ſuch ſtones as theſe are fit for <hi>A. S.</hi> his building.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas you ſay, that they <hi>could never ſhew</hi> (their opinion) <hi>out of Gods word;</hi> we anſwer, that they have often <hi>ſhewed it;</hi> but God and men (it ſeems) are not yet agreed to have it ſo generally ſeen, as is to be deſired: but our hope is, that the agreement will be concluded between them in due time.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, you conclude this reaſon, with this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that <hi>if it</hi> (your brethrens opinion we ſuppoſe you mean, though it's hard both here and in twenty places more, to know your meaning clearly) <hi>be refuſed, it will help to confirm the Churches, and the people in truth.</hi> We deſire to know <hi>in truth</hi> of what? It will indeed confirme both marvellouſly, in the truth of Presbyterian faſtneſſe to their owne cauſe; but in what other truth it ſhould confirm either the one or the other, we wait for our intelligence from you to know.</p>
               <p>Your 21. and laſt reaſon (ſave onely thoſe which you ſay you <hi>omit)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">His laſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon anſwered.</note> is but a ſlip of your ninteenth, being ſomwhat that follows out of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependencie. But here you tell us, that the <hi>Government ſo called, cannot but overthrow all ſort of Eccleſiaſticall Government. Is</hi> Saul <hi>alſo among the Prophets? Haec verba loquentis ab ore, Gaudens arripio, &amp; ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat I conceive to be of God in them. Wee know who propheſied when he was not aware of it. Indeed, by the beauty and perfect conſonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of this government with the word of God, it may very reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably (yea and upon higher termes then of reaſon) be thought that in time <hi>it cannot but overthrow all ſort of Eccleſiaſticall government,</hi> and ſtand up it ſelfe in their ſtead. <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But that which you adde in the cloſe of this Reaſon, plainly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that you had no mind to propheſie, though God had, or might have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you: for here you ſay, <hi>that this order, by neceſſary conſequence, will breed all ſort of diſorder.</hi> No, firſt, it will not breed the diſorder of oppreſſing conſcientious men for conſcience ſake: nor ſecondly, of diſcouraging men from ſearching the Scriptures more narrowly; not thirdly, of having recourſe unto the word for the ſetting up of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:196793:63"/> of Chriſts Kingdome; nor fourthly, of making men walk ſundry miles for what they might have upon as good or better termes at home, beſides a thouſand other <hi>diſorders,</hi> which the <hi>order</hi> of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependencie will never breed by any conſequence at all, <hi>neceſſary</hi> or <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> being of a very ſoveraign importance to prevent them. And for your premiſſes (in the body of your Reaſon) by which you would fain make the match, between the <hi>order</hi> of Independencie, <hi>and all ſort of diſorder,</hi> they are but falſe brokers. The Independent Churches (as you call them) <hi>have no ſuch cuſtome,</hi> as for one to give entertainment or admiſſion to any perſon, that hath been <hi>cenſured by another,</hi> without the cenſure firſt relaxed by that Church which inflicted it, or without the conſent of this Church. This is their reproach, not their practice.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee that amongſt <hi>A. S.</hi> his 21. <hi>Reaſons,</hi> there is not one that will ſtand by their Maſter, when they are but a little put to it; there is none of them but with a little perſwaſion and debate, will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly enough conſent to a <hi>Toleration</hi> for the <hi>Apologiſts.</hi> If the Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant himſelfe, with his party, were but as tractable as his reaſons, there need no more words be made about the buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>As for his after-birth of Reaſons, (p. 65.) ſince he profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that he <hi>omits them,</hi> we ſhall comport with him herein, and <hi>omit</hi> them alſo; I hope he will think himſelfe a debtor to us for this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance. It ſeems that himſelfe placeth no great confidence in them, in that hee mentions them as if hee mentioned them not, and thought them not worthy to be numbred amongſt his firſt-born. His <hi>Horſemen</hi> (you ſee) have been overcome, and yeelded themſelves: his <hi>Infantery</hi> knows the manner of the field, and will, no queſtion, ſurrender with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out incounter. Nor is there any thing for weight or ſubſtance in this <hi>Tail</hi> of Reaſons, but what hath been broken already in the <hi>Head.</hi>
